Re  What prevents mounting of USB devices      BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE      Hash  SHA   Florian Kulzer wrote    Did you have any security upgrades lately   Sure  I install them regularly  Doesn t everybody     or did you install packages from backports or volatile  I do have the following as part of my sources conf   deb   lenny volatile main contrib non free deb src   lenny volatile main contrib non free deb   lenny main  I am not sure if I actually installed anything from volatile     or any non Debian stuff    Yes  from debian multimedia org  Presumably that counts as non Debian     Another thing to try is to activate the desktop icons for removable   devices and test if users can mount the devices by clicking on the   icons   Sorry to sound stupid  but how do I activate those  Right now I don t see any icons on the desktop when plugging devices in     I suspect that the fstab entry is not really a problem  Maybe you can   setup pmount for the individual users so that it is more convenient   Yes  the pmount works fine now  it did not even require setting anything up     Unfortunately I do not understand what else your dbus error message is   trying to tell us  I would run  lshal   monitor   then plug in a USB   stick and try to mount it  maybe that will turn up something useful       Seeing what hal knows about a USB stick might also help  hal can be   queried like this       lshal  u   hal find by property   key block device   string   dev sdX     lshal  u   hal find by property   key block device   string   dev sdX          Replace  sdX  as is appropriate   Thanks for showing and explaining lshal to me  I ll explore with it and report if I find something interesting        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Using GnuPG with Mozilla      iEYEARECAAYFAkvDqA ACgkQ VSRxYk    SyACeLV a tt VKgvTwya oBz  Nu IgQAn hgk w  ykMQB vtjNRf oeLyib   B A      END PGP SIGNATURE            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
