Re  A couple of nits   On Wed     Oct               EDT   J  W  Ballantine     said     First  when I try and run exmh with wish from tk      it seems to take   forever to start  but with wish from tk  a   it starts in a snap   This sounds like something piggy in the  flist  code   I m seeing flist in general taking      seconds   Interesting that a different wish comes up fast  there might be a borkedness in         Using the latest CVS  when I open exmh and the folder I m in has unseen   messages and I hit next  exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages   rather than to the first unseen in the current folder   Hmm   weirdness      Finally  when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to   the next unseen  exmh always goes back to inbox  which has no unseen   messages  rather than the next folder with unseen messages    When I    goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go    I ve been seeing this as well    usually  with inbox  but it s gotten stuck on some other folders as well  I have procmail do rcvstore into folders for me           Valdis Kletnieks     Computer Systems Senior Engineer     Virginia Tech        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Exmh version                 iD DBQE mwd cC lWbTT  ARAsOKAKCe ziHYPQnWBGyUdYQzYurE tguACfS Ms TUQI ndQ stuJqaWVGSAi k   JBgX      END PGP SIGNATURE
