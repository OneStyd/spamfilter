 Spambayes  understanding high false negative rate       TP     Tim Peters   writes        The false positive rate is         Finally   I had to scrub a      bunch of previously unnoticed spam from my inbox    Both      collections have about      messages     TP  Does this mean you trained on about      of each   The total collections are      messages   I trained with        messages      TP  Can t guess   You re in a good position to start adding more   TP  headers into the analysis  though   For example  an easy start   TP  would be to uncomment the header counting lines in tokenize     TP   look for  Anthony     Likely the most valuable thing it s   TP  missing then is some special parsing and tagging of Received   TP  headers   I tried the  Anthony  stuff  but it didn t make any appreciable difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate  The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices   Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the words in the header and emitted like this   s   s     hdr  word   That worked too well       The received and date headers helped the classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is new   So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received  data  and x from   which all contained timestamps   I also skipped the X VM  headers that my mail reader added   class MyTokenizer Tokenizer        skip     received                   date                   x from                          def tokenize headers self  msg           for k  v in msg items                k   k lower               if k in self skip or k startswith  x vm                    continue             for w in subject word re findall v                   for t in tokenize word w                       yield   s  s     k  t   This did moderately better   The false negative rate is       over the tests performed so far   This is versus        for the previous test run that used the timtest header tokenizer   It s interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham discriminators   There s not a single spam indicator in the list  Most of the discriminators are header fields   One thing to note is that the presence of Mailman generated headers is a strong non spam indicator   That matches my intuition  I got an awful lot of Mailman generated mail  and those lists are pretty good at surpressing spam   The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use XEmacs   That s probably Barry  Guido  Fred  and me       One final note   It looks like many of the false positives are from people I ve never met with questions about Shakespeare   They often start with stuff like     Dear Sir Madam       May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a   solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly  I am old science student  I guess that reads a lot like spam       Jeremy       hams       spams     false positive                    false negative                    new false positives         new false negatives          best discriminators           x mailscanner clean                         x spam status IN REP TO                    delivered to skip s                            x mailer Lucid                    x mailer XEmacs                    x mailer patch                    x mailer under                    x mailscanner Found                         cc zope com                    i ll                    references skip                         rossum                    x spam status skip S                       van                    http  zope                    email addr zope                    from python org                    to jeremy                        zope                    list archive skip m                        list subscribe skip m                        list unsubscribe skip m                        from zope com                     return path zope com                     wrote                      jeremy                     email addr python                     x mailman version                            x mailman version                            python
