marks the only thing I ve ever written that I  expect anyone to pay for  If you happen to use OS X  go check them out   My second publication is a PDF only explanation of the process for  converting Vinyl LPs to CD  by way of your PC  how s that for alphabet  soup   For the time being  you can get it absolutely free  with the  caveat that I d appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make  it more useful  I m considering some screen shots for it if I get some  time   What are you waiting for          With the expiration of Lockergnome s old cell phone plan  Lori and I  opted to make a switch to Verizon  at the recommendation of Brian  Stevens  I m already happy with the suggestion  as our previous provider  had horrid customer service  not to mention I now have a much geekier  phone in the form of the     Palm powered unit  It s just  larger than most Palm devices on the market  but having the device  integration is nice  It has all the functionality of a Palm  with some  Internet browsing capabilities and of course  phone access  A built in  speakerphone actually works better than I expected   Now all I need to  do is get more applications installed    Of interest to anyone who signed up for   emusic  after Chris and I talked  the service up and down last week  It seems they ve added in the ballpark  of       Universal titles to their roster of offerings  Not surprising  considering they re part of the same conglomerate  but still good news  in terms of feature expansion         Jake Ludington nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp

 min  Reviewer s Tilt            Two out of work rent a cops make an attempt to break into the music  video industry in this quirky comedy  John Cusack and Tim Robbins  make this comedy work  starring as the two security guards as they  send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes  You can t help but laugh  at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive  as they are  greeted with cameos by a who s who of music and movie industry names   I m sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a  resume  but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them   especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each  other  Although this is a late    s release  one of the few    s  underground classics I hadn t previously seen   it remains relevant  to those out there who are looking to put it to the man  If you ve  ever hated the recording industry and its in crowd attitude  you ll  love this film  A closing reference to Rene s Courtyard Cafe in Santa  Monica  which is a regular stop for me every time I m in the LA area   prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing  The movie  is humorous enough for several viewings  Nothing really grabs attention  on the DVD  but then again  the studio probably expects no one will buy  it anyway          Region   Encoding  US and Canada only   Color  Closed Captioned  Widescreen  Sound  Dolby
