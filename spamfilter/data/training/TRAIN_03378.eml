Re  how to uninstall java preview On Apr          at       AM  Gabriele Kahlout wrote     Hello         Today presenting my application to a macbook user with the latest java   releasion            my application failed to install properly  see the java console  and   error JOptionPane          On my machine the same works flawlessly  However I ve this preview   installed          and so I m failing to re produce the same testing   environment  So I d like to go back to the version my users have to be   able to better assist them  unless you have better suggestions         I d be very thankful if you could also report to me if others have   problems  just launching this  you need to choose an installation   directory  and after doing so the error should appear        WARNING  THIS IS A VERY BAD THING TO DO  AND WILL PUT YOUR MACHINE INTO   AN UNSUPPORTABLE CONFIGURATION   There is no official way to roll back to the GM version  however the   installer for      Update   is at      and the      Update   is at     If you manually modify the bundle version in the    System Library Frameworks JavaVM framework Resources Info plist  the   installer should install on top of the developer preview  however it   will not be aware of some of the new content in the DP  This causes some   tools like Java VisualVM to fail  because it s bundle will contain a   hodgepodge of GM and DP bits  and the GM installer doesn t know to   remove the DP bits  because when it was created  the DP bits we not   invented yet    This should be enough to test the          JVM  but this is hardly a    valid  configuration  Installing the   M      M     DP again on top of   this mixed mess  should  clean up the GM bits and put you into a valid   DP configuration  Probably  Most likely   If things get too out of control  you should always be able to move   aside the  System Library Frameworks JavaVM framework Versions   directory  and re run either the GM or DP installer  and you should get   a fully coherent Java installation  modulo the tools in  usr share java   and a other few exceptions in  System Library which don t really change   between versions    Best of luck  Mike Swingler Java Runtime Engineer Apple Inc                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
