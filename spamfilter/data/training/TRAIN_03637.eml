RE   zzzzteana  Moon over ocean David asked     My wife noticed something odd   The nearly full moon was about       degrees above the horizon   There was a notable glow on the horizon     except under the moon   The moon seemed to be in a column of darkness    that was about three times the apparent width of the moon   We could see    the column over its entire length as a strip of sky darker than the sky    around it        Any of you ever see this   Do you have any idea what could have caused    it   I suspect it s due to some pecularity of the visual system  but    have no clear idea   Bill Jacobs    I m surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis  I could have sworn I   saw it there  He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow   and a secondary bow  I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a   semi circle of darker sky      I know I ve read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere    but I can t recall if they were reportedly dark or bright  I do know   these sorts of things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the   visual system  I m sorry I haven t got any answers  but a search   through some books on atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up   Some links   comprehensive    Atmospheric Light Phenomena    interesting observational stuff from the prior millenium including pix  click        colour plates     more pix  many of which flip to negative to highlight details  hover cursor    and subsequent links  john k                            Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                             DVDs Free  s p Join Now                                                                             To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to        Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to
