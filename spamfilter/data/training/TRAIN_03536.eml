Re  New Sequences Window  From   Robert Elz     Date   Thu     Aug                             Date         Wed     Aug                           From         Chris Garrigues         Message ID              I can t reproduce this error       Ah  I think I just found the cause  nmh is broken  which is probably   obvious from my previous mail        The man page for pick  and how it always used to work  was that  list   would list messages matched    nolist would supress that    If  sequence   is given the default is  nolist  without  sequence the default is  list       That s all fine   but it appears now  which probably means I had never   used pick since I upgraded nmh last  that what counts is the order of    list and  sequence   that is  if  sequence comes after  list  the  list   gets turned off   sequence implies  nolist instead of just making  nolist   the default        An easy workaround for this is to make sure that  list is the last arg   given to pick  so if I run          delta  pick  inbox  lbrace  lbrace  subject ftp  rbrace  rbrace                sequence mercury  list             which is just as it should be   hmmm  I assume you re going to report this to the nmh folks   Chris      Chris Garrigues                   virCIO                                Congress  Suite     Austin  TX                            World War III   The Wrong Doers Vs  the Evil Doers           BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Exmh version                          iD DBQE ZP lK b h R IUIRAhSFAJ dWespJZxDa q t yyulLXBp ryACfUF D ltpgX KXYwpbhGV bUHY gY   H ck      END PGP SIGNATURE
