Re   ILUG  Mail sent to ILUGThanks lads   I didn t mean to criticise give offence or anything  someone mailed me off list who seemed to think I did  but I was just wondering  if anything could be done  about those messages  Maybe it was a stupid question  seeing as I know virtually nothing about mailman  listservs  or server side spam filtering  but thanks for answering intelligently   Ciaran  Waider elucidated     Martin Feeney wrote      On Tue     Aug               Ciaran Mac Lochlainn wrote           is it really necessary to send these to the list              What s happening is that the scumbag spammers are forging the from     address to be   as well  so the notification to them that     their email is being reviewed gets sent back to the from address                Martin          Not to belabour the point  but noone can legitimately send mail to ilug   from    so Mailman should be catching this and stopping it    Not sending confirms or whatever  just dropping the mail on the floor      Cheers    Waider         Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
