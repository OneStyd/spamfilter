 ILUG  hwclockHello  I ve got a small problem but still annoying  I upgraded from RH     to  RH     and everything looks ok except that the time is ahead by one  hour  I ve been looking the man files for hwclock and options but it  simply doesn t work  it gives the following error from he shell as well  as from the startup while loading the kernel   hwclock  ioctl   to   dev rtc to turn on update interrupts failed unexpectedly  errno      Inappropriate ioctl for device       my solution at the time is to enter the setup of the PC and reduce  the time by one hour  awful   Regards  Felipe PRL  DCU        Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
