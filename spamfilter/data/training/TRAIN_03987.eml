 Razor users  Re  No results from razor check on known spam I seem to be getting the known spam message numbers  now  using         now  I m just wondering about the error at the end of the  check report procedure   On Mon     Aug       Chad Norwood wrote          This is bizarre  The numbers should not just disappear   Try      with the   n  switch which prints out a     before legit mails         razor check  n mail caughtspam          If that still appears broken  can you do the following statement and     send me  spam fileno  and  razor log          razor check  n  logfile razor log  dl    mail caughtspam  spam fileno           chad        On                       Mike Burger wrote      Since last night  I ve been getting odd results   or  rather  a lack of     results from razor check           I am using SpamAssassin  and have my  procmailrc set up to dump any tagged     spam into its own folder under my   mail directory           When I get any new messages in that folder  I run razor check against      them  like so           razor check          Previously  if I just ran razor check against such a batch of spam  it      would report the message numbers  in the batch  that were known spam   I      would then delete the known spam from the batch  and then run           razor report          to submit the rest  after confirming that      it was  indeed  spam   I should tell you that since using SA       I ve      had less than    of the messages it s tagged wind up as false positives       but I ve taken the advice of many here  and am not just automatically      reporting            As I said  previously  razor check would tell me which messages were known      spam   For example  if I ran razor check against a batch of   messages       and message    and    were known spam  the end result would look like      this                            But  starting yesterday  it stopped doing this   Now  I ve got to call           razor check  d          And look for the  mail id   is known spam  before I can eliminate it           The last   messages I checked  I had to do the same thing           I ve changed nothing in my razor installation or configuration           Any ideas what might have changed  here  I m running razor agents            and razor agents sdk                 Thanks             Mike                                                                                This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek     Welcome to geek heaven                                                                Razor users mailing list                                                                           This sf net email is sponsored by  Dice   The leading online job board for high tech professionals  Search and apply for tech jobs today                                                    Razor users mailing list
