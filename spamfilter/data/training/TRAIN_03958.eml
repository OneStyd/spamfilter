Re  Compositing two moviesI can verify that these calls do actually work for synchronization  I   grab the master time base of the movie I am considering the master    which can be arbitrary  so just pick one  and set the master time base   of the other movies using that  They stay in perfect lock step for the   rest of the way for me    Matt   On Apr           at       PM  James Walker wrote     On                PM  Rapha EBl Ding E  wrote          Yes  sure  but my point was only about having two movies perfectly in   sync     and this sample code is just a way to achieve it          I tried adding the bit about GetMovieTimeBase and   SetTimeBaseMasterTimeBase to my project  and it didn t seem to help   synchronization         I also tried making a movie with references to the two video tracks    so that the video tracks would be playing in the same movie  and they   still don t stay synchronized when playing         It looks like I may have to require that the two movies be somehow   preprocessed to be side by side in a single video track             James W  Walker  Innoventive Software LLC                                                                                                        Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
