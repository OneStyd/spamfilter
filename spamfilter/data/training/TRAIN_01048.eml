Re  how to uninstall java preview On                   Gabriele Kahlout wrote    I ll be even more thankful now  if you guys may report to me if an error is   encountered just launching this  you need to choose an installation   directory  and after doing so the error could appear         Yes an error occurs   Users sam crap  Desktop MemorizEasy derby properties  no such file or directory    It s a correct error too  Using the install dialog I tried to make folder   Desktop crap   but maybe messed up  that dialog is horrid  because it s actually created a folder   crap   Which is empty  and note this isn t   crap  Desktop as in the error message above  So it s looking in the wrong place   By the way that install dialog is REALLY horrible     Especially that you re just thrown into it  I hope you can remove the install process  You could make it into a  dmg distributed  app bundle for Mac users instead of WebStart at all  which would be nice   WebStart can be ok too  but please make it really be WebStart  ie let Java manage where the program files are stored  Either way  there s no need to make users select a folder for user data either   you can automatically store any user data files somewhere reasonable like   Library Application Support yourapp on Mac  the equivalent Application Data folder on Windows  and    AppName on other platforms   Either  normal WebStart  or   app bundle in DMG  would give you an app that requires no configuration or installation process  making it much easier less scary for users to install and try out your app  Would probably also sidestep this platform bug            sam  PS If it wasn t clear  I haven t installed the developer preview yet  so still on             really need to do that soon                                                   Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
