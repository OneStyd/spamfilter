Re  What needs to improve in KDE   On    May             Ferdinand Thommes   wrote       Nepomuk   Strigi need to improve a  lot     yes  for sure  It has  it s down to   MB of memory in KDE           What version  Strigi in     seems rather usable  those issues sound    like familiar     issues      The whole virtuoso strigi ensemble needs a lot of polishing  It is not re  ady   for simple usage yet    I have spent some days fiddling with that stuff based on my own experienc  e and   feedback i got from users at sidux    The best way i found to have a usable index is     C  A   stop nepomuk and strigi in systemsettings    C  A   move away or delete everything in       kde share apps nepomuk repository main data virtuosobackend    there might be incompatible database from virtuoso   x in there     C  A   out and back in to your account    C  A   start nepomuk andv strigi    C  A   let it do the indexing    C  A   test  in dolphin  krunner is unreliable atm  your index    C  A   see if e g  files under kmail got indexed     for me to have a complete index i had to do   runs of strigi    in the first   runs it would not even touch any dot files under  kde   in the end it works fine now but popular searches use a lot of ram     Please test Strigi and Nepomuk in KDE Trunk        and if you have problems let me know or file issues  It s all been heavily reworked and should really be usable now          Dotan Cohen            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
