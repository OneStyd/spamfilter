Re  Apt repository authentication  it s timeOnce upon a time  Brian wrote           OK  it s now time to work out the PGP securing of apt repository        traffic  I ve never gotten anything but  sitename whatever will not        be authenticated  until running Redhat     when I get something        about having  No Key  for various files   I don t think gpg signing my repositories will help anything  as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md  signatures of all pgklists and srclists  Basically  you ll then just be sure that it s me who generated the files  and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up   In Red Hat Linux     though  the warnings about  No Key  appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm  for example   rpm   import  usr share doc apt      cnc  RPM GPG KEY  this will import my key  which is used to sign all freshrpms net packages   Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install  only  packages who verify against an imported gpg key  This for me would be the optimal way to ensure integrity with the way things curently work   Matthias      Clean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages     Red Hat Linux release      Valhalla  running Linux kernel          acpi Load                                                                   RPM List mailing list
