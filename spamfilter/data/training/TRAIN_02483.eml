Re  grub savedefault On Sun  May          at      PM  Celejar   wrote    On Sun     May                        Todd A  Jacobs    wrote       When one has multiple kernels installed  where is one supposed to    configure the option to always boot the last selected kernel  I can t    make sense of all the automatic over writing that the grub scripts are    doing on Debian  and the  etc default grub file doesn t have an example    of what the scripts are looking for        I just want to be able to select a kernel at boot  and have that be the    default until a new kernel is installed or I manually select something    else      What seems to work for me  and I agree  it s pretty confusing    especially when you add  man grub set default  to the mix  is to   include these three lines in menu lst      default saved     updatedefaultentry true     savedefault true     I m not quite certain which are necessary  but as I ve said  this seems   to give me the behavior that I  and  IIUC  you  want   I don t think that you need    updatedefaultentry true  if you are using  default saved   IIUC  I only has any meaning in the case of  default x  where x is a number   IIUC     savedefault true  will append  savedefault  to the menu entries and  booting from one of those entries turns it into the default at the next boot if you choose  default saved    I have not tried  default saved  with grub   but with grub  it will not work  the first time that you set it  if you don t run  grub set default x  where x is the default entry that you want  the count starts with           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
