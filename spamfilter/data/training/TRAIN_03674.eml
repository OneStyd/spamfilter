Re  Visual glitches all over the placeHi   I sent the email below earlier today to this list  but apparently it didn t go through  Maybe attachments are not allowed  If that s the case  I apologize   Anyway  the original email is below  and the figure showing the visual glitches I mention can be retrieved at    Any help is greatly appreciated   Thank you   Adriano   On Fri  Apr          at      AM  Adriano Vilela Barbosa   wrote    Hi      I m using KDE       on Debian Testing and over the past few days I   started seeing lots of visual glitches all over the place  To have an   idea of what I m talking about  please take a look at the attached   file  which is a screenshot of my desktop  Even non Qt applications   are affected  Look for example at the horizontal scroll bar in the   window showing an audio waveform at the bottom  It s totally   corrupted  That s a Praat      window  which uses the LessTif toolkit      These problems happen on my laptop  However  I don t see any of that   on my desktop  which also runs Debian Testing  with pretty much the   same set of packages installed  An immediate difference between the   two systems is that the laptop has an ATI card using the free radeon   driver  whereas the desktop has an nVidia GeForce card using the   proprietary nvidia driver  I suspect some upgrade over the past few   days is the culprit  I m going to do some testing over the weekend so   I can provide more details  but for now I would like to know if   anybody else has experienced such problems      Thanks a lot      Adriano         To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
