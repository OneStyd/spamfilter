RE  Java is for kiddiesOn Sun    Sep       Reza B Far  eBuilt  wrote         C and C   forces the developer to solve problems such as memory   management over and over again   IMHO  Java is superior because the problem   of programming in the future is not about   s and   s  making the compiler      faster  or making your code take    less memory    It s about design   patterns  architecture  high level stuff     Considering     of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or device drivers   C still rules the world         Java is not just a programming language  It s also a platform    There   is NOTHING like the standard API s in Java in C and C     Everyone defines   their own API s  people end up solving the same problems ten different ways  The problem is the problem you re trying to solve is never the same  Java will soon suffer API rot  alot of poeple are already complaining about it   it s just new  C was clean in the beginning too  API rot is PURELY a function of age         If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C  you   can t possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within   the same magnitude of cost as Java      I do this all the time  It s alot easier then you think if the original programmer had a clue at all    Java does remove the clue requirement tho  just adds a huge testing requirement  QA guys aren t as cheap           Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a   person    Java  IMHO  reduces the dependence of these entities on the   individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is   to reverse engineer C  large applications    No it s not  but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high school  Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming   and it s working     Adam L   Duncan  Beberg
