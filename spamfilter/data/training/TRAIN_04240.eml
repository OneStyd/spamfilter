Re   ILUG  RH    on Cobalt   the saga continuesOn Tue  Aug          at         AM        Anders Holm mentioned    let me guess  you haven t tried the boot parameter root  dev hda  if you   are using lilo     Ah  you see   cobalt s don t use lilo  They have an openboot like prom that looks in an ext  partition in  dev hda  for a file called  boot vmlinux gz   nothing else    The only way I think you can set parameters is with a  set params  line    However  when I run      set params root  dev hda   and then run      bfd  boot vmlinux gz   It boots the old kernel  I assume from the prom  It seems to do this  if something goes wrong   no error  just boots the default kernel    BTW   bfd  means  boot from disk    Kate       Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
