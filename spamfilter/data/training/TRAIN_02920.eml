And yet more absurdity I knew it d be a day for insanity   so anyway  news com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the DMCA and decided to link to decss exe  the very verboten code that ended up getting       but none of the other news services that originally linked  spanked   Slashdot  of course  links to them   So now  I link to slashdot      I find this all incredibly funny really   Congress  and  the courts relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are applied   For the most part  these rules are coming down to whose friend you happen to be  how nefarious the defendant party is  and how asleep the judge is behind the case  asleep self interested bought   Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer  thats for sure         Best regards   bitbitch                          mailto
