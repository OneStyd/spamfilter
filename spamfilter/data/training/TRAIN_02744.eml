Re  Trying to install Google Earth on Lenny   How on earth      On Mon     May                      EDT   Lisi wrote       I have been trying to install Google Earth on Lenny       Lisi   This is not really an answer to your question  but rather an alternative  especially since you are short of time  Both Yahoo and Mapquest have aerial photos available  down to fairly decent resolution in most areas   I can clearly pick out my house on a    x     lot using it   It may be adequate for your purposes   And in public places  such as the capitol building  I can pick out individual people  though I obviously can t tell who they are   Try  for example         To see actual photographs  click on  Aerial map  in the upper right hand corner   By default  it shows street names too  but you can turn that off by clicking off the check box for  show labels    The zoom control is in the upper left hand corner of the picture   HTH                  Stephen Powell                                  To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
