Re  Middle button click broken  Pierre Baguis       I have installed XQuartz       under        and now the middle    button click is broken   I have the same  and it works for me     The window manager is Gnome and the middle click instead of pasting    the selection  it just switches the focus to another window  Ctrl c    and ctrl v the selection stopped also working  Is there some way to    restore this functionality   Run xev from a terminal window  If you move the mouse cursor into the  window that pops up  hold it still there and click the middle button   you should see something like this   ButtonPress event  serial     synthetic NO  window  x             root  x     subw  x   time                       root                 state  x   button    same screen YES  ButtonRelease event  serial     synthetic NO  window  x             root  x     subw  x   time                       root                 state  x     button    same screen YES  If it says button    your X   setup is okay  If not  please run this  command and tell us the output      defaults read org x x    If your xev run does give you button   events  then there is probably  something wrong with your window manager setup     Harald                                                  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  X   users mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
