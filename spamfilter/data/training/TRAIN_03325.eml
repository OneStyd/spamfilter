Re  Electric car an Edsel   On   Sep       RossO wrote     John Waylan  who was interviewed in Wired a few years back  pulled out a        second run in the quarter mile    mph   on a battery pack that   hasn t been broken in yet  He expects to break his record next year   topping his     sec   mph run a couple of years ago  He s shooting for a      second run   Battery pack  huh what     You dont use batteries for a     mile run  you use capacitors  MANY times the energy density  and you can get the energy out fast enough  Note that the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run anyway  just like a gas dragster is refueled  so this wouldnt be cheating      MPH should be no problem     Adam L   Duncan  Beberg
