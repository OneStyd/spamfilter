A Non Integer Power Function on the Pixel ShaderURL    Date            T                This feature  excerpted from Wolfgang Engel s ShaderX book from Wordware  Publishing  presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel  approximation of a non integer power function  The technique works for input  values between   and   and supports large exponents  The presented shader does  not require any texture look up and is scalable  making it possible to spend  more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents
