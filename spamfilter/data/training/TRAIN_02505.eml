iSight   setFrameRateHi all   with respect to my problem that the video callback is triggered more   often than I want to  see below  I had a guess that it is related to the   device frame rate  In that context I tried to set the frame rate of my   inbuilt iSight to   and SGGetFrameRate did confirm this        err   D SGSetFrameRate videoData  sgchanVideo IntToFixed        Fixed  frameRate    SGGetFrameRate videoData  sgchanVideo frameRate     int rate   D FixedToInt  frameRate     cout  dFC  videoBlocker  lock       sj  dFC  videoWaiter  wait sj  dFC  videoBlocker       err   D SGIdle videoData  seqGrab      usleep                    FRAMERATE     sj  dFC  videoBlocker  unlock          In this example the thread waits for   second before executing the next   time  which results in a frame rate of   fps  However  I discovered some    strange system behavior  which forced me to verify if this is really   the case  I applied a time measurement between each data proc function   call and in fact it is executed   more times ins between in approx        microsecond intervals  In the following I have plotted the measured   interval times in ms                                                                                                                                                                  etc      and so forth  This is actually not happening when I reside   above a framerate of    fps  Can anyone tell me why this is happening   and how I can prevent this to happen       Thanks a lot in advance  best     A l e x                                                  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
