UAE Ami  Linux Laptop   Important details Well  for one  it would free up the similar laptop I already got to just run Amithlon  or if that wasn t so fun  bsd  to run just OpenBSD   This is a near term thing I could look forward to   However  an  official  laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned   Most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a Dell       preferably     GeForce      Go or newer  pleasingly modern GPU  the    GeForce Go  with   MB video RAM  too little  I have is    not so much too slow as inefficient  with factory settings it would    actually crash from running too hot and too fast      Accelerating the Ami  and possibly OpenUAE graphics    is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments     but an energy efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and     portability  read  battery lifetime  enabler         Great control over CPU state  by use of  internet keys      wired to BIOS bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll     wheel   Also  hibernate that works  please        Bootable to USB     drives  e g  larger external ones      in BIOS  please      P  Dells overheat   They have a big heatsink and a little fan    to pull air through it  and if you don t elevate thelaptop off    the desk or table or bed it s on  the fan will  stay  on   Not good   for MTBS  mean time between service  unless you ve got an   angle on making money on service from Amigans            One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs   behind the AMLCD  thus using the backside of the display   half as a radiator   though it interferes with the case notion   below    yes  Aavid or such makes some as a standard part         I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative   mass in elevating the laptop  i e  in the form of a catch handle   and second logo device behind the laptop  which generally   provides stow and attachment for elevation legs  move them   out farther to get to the next higher ekevation  until the sides   of the laptop are met    This also happens to provide a little   protection for USB    and      cables that I tend to keep   plugged in all the time  a bit longer port life  Please        A case color other than brown or black  and preferably  if the     display module NRE is entirely permissive  the capability to      run with the backlight off    Again  to save battery power  but     also as a feature  maybe you remember the iBooks modified    in this manner   The user has the privilege to pull out the    backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe CF assembly  with    its backreflector  and the whole warrantee   This provides    for excellent outdoor use  often with the diffuser reinserted    to keep depth of field distractions minimised       What would I like   A     putty color  any translucency     in or over a rosewood colored  in KDE color browser  I see    chocolate  firebrick and a couple of  indian red  that are great    candidates  base          I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight     without closing the lid  and to be  able  to fit an  external      light source such as a UV filtered solar collector  and glare     hood  to feed     into the backlight   Not only does this make an excellent      color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably        The logo should be a coloration of a    minimal surface  as the MAA is trying to get me to renew    with   demos at      at first blush   We ll see what comes out of the contest and    maybe you ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the    logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the    openness of AmigaOS  Ami  and Amiga community     MAA org has more references  I m sure      Obviously Elfin details   e g  the backlight inlet   Other details  USB  x preferred  FireWire would be needed if that s unavailable  Options like       b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port should round out the offering   An option for just released      micron P   with mobile power features  could make more reviewers greenlight the series  much better power consumption  and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that  CompactFlash  SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card interfaces would be very pleasant   I ve mentioned booting to USB  and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also  To that end  a backup solution with compression using USB   storage or the multimode drive is always a nice  bundle item  that or a chance to back out a patch under   OS        Blue skies  and clear water and fresh air    Waterproof to    feet    Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi  Svelte    line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED  builtin G  cellphone functions  choice of side and  frontpanel trim  Ivory like stuff inscribed with M  k memory map and various OS     structures or textured fur that says  This is Amiga Speaking  when stroked  round   Decent keyboard  as in Toshiba or IBM laptops  perhaps  an ergonomic fingerworks com device  they work as  keyboard and mouse  as the keyboard trackpad    Directional planar mics atop AMLCD  soundcard with multiple     bit A D and noise reduction DSP that work in our  second through fourth  at least  favorite OS  Actual    bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation  fan location for real void comp  the test in Blade Runner  style cooling and extended bass  active cooling and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user seat and provide mineral water  HyperTransport ports
