Re   ILUG  packaging risks and the reputation of linux distributionsBrendan Kehoe wrote    As a workaround  the various distributions could use a GPG singature to verify    correctness of the file   Since the distributor s secret key is required to    create that signature  it would add a pretty significant step that would have    to be taken to make it possible to replace both a rpm or apt file and its    accompanying signature   Check your local friendly Red Hat installation      up date   rpm   checksig zsh         src rpm zsh         src rpm  md  gpg ok  Of course  this is only as useful as  say  the gpg keys distributed with  the Kernel tarballs  i e  if you don t actually bother checking the sig  then you are open to abuse  It s entirely possible that rpm can be  configured to require good signatures  but I ve not read that part of  the fine manual just yet   Cheers  Waider          Yes  it  is  very personal of me      Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
