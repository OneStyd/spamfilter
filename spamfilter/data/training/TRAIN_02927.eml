Re  What needs to improve in KDE   I ccd you since you ccd me  Please do not cc me in the future  I read the    list and that new thread grouping features of KMail are really handy      Am Dienstag    Mai      schrieb Dotan Cohen    On    May             Martin Steigerwald   wrote      Am Montag    Mai      schrieb Nate Bargmann         On         May              Dotan Cohen wrote         Yes      and now     seem to behave badly without a clean    kde         I find that very disturbing and unstable               For the record  I had a clean    kde for     when it hit Sid about a      year ago and upgraded the offered KDE packages through        IIRC       and then started with a clean    kde for Sid s new                       Nate               IMHO when a config setting is not handled properly on upgrade of KDE     its a bug         Agreed  but it s not one that is likely to be fixed  There seems to be   no backwards compatibility in KDE anymore  It s a problem  I know   Well I got no reply to my detailed bug report yet       I migrated configuration from KDE        and just pressed on  Reset     to defaults  for quite some appearance related settings in order to     switch them to Oxygen  There have been issues  but I mostly didn t     file them as bugs             Only one I triaged and filed  The separator      for colon for web     shortcuts in kuriikwsrc or something like that it was is not     recognized by KRunner  only by Konqueror      instead works with     both  Unfortunately Konqueror saved it as      not as             It  should  be escaped   It doesn t work in krunner when it is  See here    Bug         New  webshortcuts broken after upgrading KDE   to   due to    decimal in keyword delimiter which krunner doesnt support            Anyway I suggest to file those issues as concrete as possible as bugs     as you manage to take time for it   I did so really  This bug report contains quite some hints on testing with      an empty configuration  Its as easy as that   mkdir    kde test export KDEHOME  D   kde test  Then start your KDE application you want to test with empty settings from    this shell  You can also easily see what configuration files the applicatio  n    or the subsystems it uses create   Ciao    D     Martin  Helios  Steigerwald     GPG    B   D C            AFA  B  F    B EAAC A      C        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvpstgACgkQmRvqrKWZhMduJwCffZhDp Ipn  jl egTkEZXA P jMsAn ImjLAG gZPHlcMMnsP JNW   A   fht      END PGP SIGNATURE
