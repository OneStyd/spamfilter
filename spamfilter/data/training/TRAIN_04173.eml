Re  Nil messaging statement in  Cocoa Fundimentals Guide   misleading P S  Matter of fact  far as I understant plain English  the first part   is somewhat cryptic  too   On May           at      AM  David Hoerl wrote     In your program E       s control flow statements  you can test for   the presence  or absence  of the appropriate negative literal to   determine how to proceed  For example  the following while statement   from the SimpleCocoaTool code implicitly tests the word object variable   for the presence of a returned object  or  in another sense  the absence   of nil          while  word   D  enm nextObject     printf   s n    word UTF String         I am not quite sure what s an  appropriate negative literal  and whether   it s present or absent  but perhaps it s just that there s a fine point   there which escapes me  I do admit I did not check the doc  it might use   the term before in a way which makes the statement unambiguous    What s    IMHO of course    pretty misleading is what follows though    Seems to me we are checking the word object variable very very   explicitly    you can t be much more explicit in testing XXX than   writing  while  XXX     What we are    in fact    testing  implicitly  is whether the  enm    object variable might contain nil   Or do implicit explicit mean something else in English than in all other   languages I bumped into   Best      Ondra  C   Cada OCSoftware                        private                                                                             Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Objc language mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
