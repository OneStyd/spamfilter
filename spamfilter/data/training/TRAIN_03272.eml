Sept     Dallas        Dear TSS Members       I thought you d be interested to know that The Middleware Company has created a J EE Patterns training course that I will be co teaching in Dallas during the week of September   th  The course combines and improves upon the best J EE design patterns material available in my book EJB Design Patterns  Sun s Core Patterns  TheServerSide s patterns repository and others            I have just reviewed the final material and I am very excited with the end product  This class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today  both from a theoretical and a practical perspective  One of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications  including TheServerSide com        I highly recommend this course to the seasoned J EE developer who wants to master the cutting edge in J EE architecture and design        If you d like to register for the course  simply click here          Sincerely      Floyd Marinescu   Author  EJB Design Patterns   Director of TheServerSide com J EE Community            Back to Top

services  which will granulate into representing all data in XML  For preparing and implementing Web services  it s necessary to express all data in XML  This pattern does the same                    Widget Pages                      By Guilherme Silva                  This pattern allows for using XMLC and Barracuda without exposing their APIs to widget users  In fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time  which is ideal for migrating or upgrading                      Back to Top                                   New App Server Reviews

                    Meta Group  J EE Complexity Holding Back Platform Adoption          The Meta Group has released a research report saying that the relative complexity of doing server side development using J EE is hurting adoption of the platform  Among other predictions are the continuing dominance of BEA and IBM  more consolidation  and increasing vendor competition in tools and frameworks                                  IBM nudges back release of WebSphere              IBM has rescheduled its release of J EE     certified Websphere Application Server   from September to
