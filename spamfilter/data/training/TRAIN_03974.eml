Re  Debian on a Super Lean Laptop Part I   Making it WorkOn Wed  Apr          at         PM        Scarletdown wrote    This may  at first glance  appear to be an exercise into insanity  but it   is   a rather important little project to me         I have this old Toshiba Satellite laptop  P       GB had drive  and a   whoppong   MB RAM  that is currently running   SE Lite   It runs adequate  ly   on Windows  but now I would like to make it dual boot with Debian            The build box boots the bare bones build beautifully   However  the laptop   hangs when I try to boot into Linux   Specifically  the last thing shown   on   the screen before nothing else happens is         initrd  boot initrd img                   Linux initrd    x  b       x  cdf  bytes         After that  she s locked up tight  and all I can do is power off         This is obviously a problem with initrd   Set too large for such a low   memory system perhaps   If so  what can be done to fix this   Perhaps  You could certainly build a kernel that doesn t require the initrd  You d probably benefit a lot from running a custom kernel anyway     E    A       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEARECAAYFAkvPtUsACgkQaIeIEqwil aHnQCg NurLOQsbDEuZF IeKabwxxC BecAoNcvDB Z ZktU R eMaFJYLlqeR   kNu       END PGP SIGNATURE
