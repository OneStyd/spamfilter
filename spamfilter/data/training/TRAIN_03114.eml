Re  DataPower announces XML in siliconOn Tue     Aug       Rohit Khare wrote     DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed   specifically to process XML data  Unlike competing solutions that   process XML data in software  DataPower s device processes the data in   hardware    a technology achievement that provides greater performance    according to company officials   Now  to do this  we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used on all transaction in order to process them    So this has some preaty heavy implications  unless it s just BS     Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up   to    times  This  he said  makes processing the data very taxing on   application servers  DataPower believes an inline device is the best   alternative   Or     you could just not bloat it   x to begin with  Nah   that was the whole point of XML afterall  to sell more CPUs   much like Oracle s use of Java allows them to sell  x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit     In addition to the large file sizes  security is also of paramount   importance in the world of XML       Today s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only   Kelly   said   A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall    Firewalls are blind to XML today    Again  see above    they  are  claiming to decode the crypto        Our XG  execution core converts XML to machine code   said Kelly   Mmmmmmmmmmm  machine code  never a good idea       Adam L   Duncan  Beberg
