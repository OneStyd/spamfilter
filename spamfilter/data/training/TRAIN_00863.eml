Re  debuild of evolution data server failsOn Fri             at              Sven Joachim wrote    On                         John A  Sullivan III wrote           Hello  all  We are trying to rebuild the evolution data server package     after patching it to hopefully end our current email nightmare   The     base system is Lenny but we are using evolution from squeeze   When I     try to debuild  I am getting the following errors          checking for GNOME PLATFORM    configure  error  Package requirements      glib        D                    gtk         D               I think this is the problem  since lenny has only gtk                The   build dependencies in debian control might not be correct   Note that   lenny backports has a newer version  though                   ORBit        D                   libbonobo        D                    gconf        D                   libglade        D                   libxml        D                   libsoup        D        were not met          Package zlib was not found in the pkg config search path      Perhaps you should add the directory containing  zlib pc      to the PKG CONFIG PATH environment variable     Package  zlib   required by  GnuTLS   not found         zlib is installed         True  but the zlib g dev package in lenny does not ship a zlib pc file    the version in squeeze does           I did not check all the listed packages but the ones     I checked were installed with the latest versions   My command sequence     was          apt get  t testing source evolution data server  as non root      apt get  t testing build dep evolution data server  as root         This might not do what you want   When you fetch the build dependencies   from testing  the built packages will likely also depend on libraries   not present in stable   But it appears to be impossible to build   squeeze s evolution data server in lenny anyway  see above            patched evolution data server     edited debian changelog and debian rules  disabled gnome key ring   als  o     tried it with this enabled as per the default      debuild  uc  us         What am I doing wrong  We are rather desperate to get this running         There are various possibilities  all not very appealing           Install the lenny backport of gtk      and see what s necessary to get     the zlib pc file into the libz g dev package   Resolve further build     problems by installing packages from lenny backports or creating your     own backports   You may want to hire somebody to do the work           Upgrade to squeeze  deal with the ensuing breakage and hope that it     will freeze in a few months           use Ubuntu       or whatever current distribution has the new     evolution data server and deal with whatever bugs these distributions     have         I would go for the first option  but note that you should set   GDK NATIVE WINDOWS  D  in the environment if you upgrade gtk      to   version       otherwise several applications might break C  B          Sven              C  B              The upgrade to the squeeze zlib did the trick but now I ve hit what I think is a linker problem   libtool  link  only absolute run paths are allowed  I ran libtoolize and aclocal but that didn t seem to help   Off to Google to find out what this is   Thanks   John       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
