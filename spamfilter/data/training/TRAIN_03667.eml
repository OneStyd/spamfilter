Creditors and shareholders of U S  Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation s sixth largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection   The Arlington  Va  based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code s Chapter     but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept      Remember when all U S  airports reopened except for Reagan Washington  which was too close to the White House and other gov sites  Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last  Guess which airline was the  major carrier there   Hint  It s the same one that bled    billion in the past year    Even before the terror attacks  U S  Airways was an animal in pain  To all the usual industry troubles  add these  fierce competition from discounters  a too small area of service concentrated on the East Coast  and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business  Frustrated  the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago  reminded the Washington Post  In a bid to get bought by United  U S  Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was too small to survive on  its own  The feds disagreed and blocked the deal   Now  of course  U S  Airways has a new flight plan  Among those likely to get airsick  shareholders  whose investment has vanished  employees  many of whom are expected to lose their jobs  even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay  and creditors  especially plane leasing companies  which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves   Where  by the way  is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies  Not one creditor was named in any account we could find  Yet before we soak our hankies over U S  Airways  we d like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed    Need a silver lining  Check out the Wall Street Journal  which observes that Continental Airlines  soared to profitability  thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago  We re guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group  which is plunking down      million for two fifths of U S  Airways  Texas  Pacific also played friend in need to Continental    and pocketed    times its investment   Meanwhile  it will be  business as usual  for U S  Airways customers  the company s chief assured a skeptical New York Times  The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent flier miles  Better still  Cautious customers can use U S  Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner  United  And  hey  according to an analyst quoted in the Journal   there s at least a     chance that United won t be the next major carrier to announce it s gone broke    Lori Patel  US Airways Files for Chapter       US Airways

                        Follow up has never been the media s strong suit  Once stories fade from page one  so does reporters  interest  And in this summer of corporate scandals  remembering back to Global Crossing s January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to  recall the fuss over chads   The Financial Times pegged the company s bankruptcy sale Friday a  long awaited  transaction  but few other outlets seemed to be  holding their breath  The dearth of coverage is too bad  because  the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention  especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter    aisle  Bankruptcy  it seems  means never having to say you re sorry  Global Crossing owed     billion when it filed  for bankruptcy in January  Its sale price       million    and that s for only a nearly two thirds stake  Sound too low  Back in January  Global Crossing could have gotten much more  three times that much  and from the very same investment team  Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia  But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more    Now that it has discovered it s worth way less  here s how the deal carves up what s left of Global Crossing s pie  pending the  regulatory approval that s expected in about six months  The two  investors get a       stake  bank creditors get     and bondholders get about a one third share  Who s missing from the slice and dice  Shareholders  of course  who get nothing  The company is unapologetic  and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs   The reality is we could have done considerably worse   the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder  a lawyer for  the creditors  As for the shrewd buyers  the Financial Times quoted Hutchison s official statement that the deal would extend  its telecom capabilities  particularly in its broadband service   But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher    Global Crossing s turned down offer of      million is approximately the same amount the company s founder  Gary Winnick  reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock  as the Journal noted in its page one story
