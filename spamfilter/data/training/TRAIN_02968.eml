Re  Replies to the list     BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE      Hash  SHA   Camale  n   writes     On Mon     Apr                      Merciadri Luca wrote       Camale  n writes        I use Gmane  e mail to news gateway  to send posts and read the list     via Pan newsreader          From time to time Gmane have had some  glitches   messages can be     delayed     or in the worst cases  they are lost  but if the post reached the list     archive  you  everyone subscribed  also should get it                 But the matter is that I can see  all  your answers everywhere  but by    e mail  where some answers  only from you  are completely unreceived      One thing you could do is contact the mail list admin and ask for a    concrete  Message ID    of one of the e mails you didn t receive  to    check if it was correctly sent out to all the list members  Before doing this  you could try to send me an e mail to my e mail adress  at ulg   It is quite possible that my university blocks your e mail for a reason which is still unknown to me     True is that I m not sure how to manage this  I m reluctant to think your    e mail provider is dropping  just  my e mais    that makes no sense       You may try to send me a test e mail  for example your answer to a message  We will discuss after  But that s weird         Merciadri Luca See          Procrastination is the thief of time       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Processed by Mailcrypt           iEYEARECAAYFAkvVfxIACgkQM LLzLt MhxZeQCdHBqnWyRuOmuA   pBjs a  M ku An WGksLqSErwbwjmIy rZLYYYYRp   Fyu      END PGP SIGNATURE            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
