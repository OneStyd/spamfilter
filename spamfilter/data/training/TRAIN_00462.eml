Re   ILUG  PCTel modulesOn               Thu  Sep          at         PM         eric nichols wrote    Hello again  I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at   the end of it  everything still goes smoothly until I type  make    after I get the output from the   configure        However  there were a couple of things I noticed along the way  After typing      cp configs kernel       config  config     make oldconfig     make dep   The  nd to last line I got back said that the modversions h file was   not updated  When I looked at this path to the modversions h file  it   was     lines and every line started with a   mark    Is it the case   that nothing is read on a line after a   mark  or am I just thinking   of another language   and so should I delete the   at certain places  No that is appropriate content for the file   I m not a C programmer  but I think that these sort of things   include    are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre processor in the compile process  and include all sorts of symbols functions e g    include    gives you maths type functions   Since they start with     they are ignored in the final compilation   Regarding the rest of the compile process  you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers source   I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag       with kernel includes  usr src linux     which could be passed to the   configure script  with the appropriate directory in place of  usr src linux        This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers   I think this is the right way to proceed   Alternatively  maybe the steps above regarding  make dep  and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions h   Co   I don t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below   First of all you will move modversions h  which you have done   then you would have to move all those   ver files  after that  there will almost certainly be a need for further header    h  files   This could be quickly done  but is probably bad  those files don t really belong there    For what it s worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation   m       Also  when I was in the pctel directory and typed  make   I noticed   that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions h   file  Inside this other file  there s nothing at all  And so I moved   the modversions h file with     lines to the empty modversions h file     and got a different reply after  make   The output after I moved the   file over mostly looked like this     usr src linux          linux modversions h          linux modules adb ver  No such file or directory    usr src linux          linux modversions h          linux modules af ax   ver  No such file or directory    usr src linux          linux modversions h          linux modules af ipx ver  No such file or directory      The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are   what s written after the   in the modversions h file  Should there be   a file at each of these  one at each of the     lines of the file    that I d have to compile make       Michael Conry   Ph                  Web    Key fingerprint        B          C   A     CB      B        DE    C      Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
