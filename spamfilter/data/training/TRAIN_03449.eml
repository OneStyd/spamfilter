Re  PDF is blocked for printing  etc  OK for acroread  it behaves  as expected   but KPDF allows me to print it  even if it is protected  Why      BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE      Hash  SHA   Merciadri Luca wrote    Johannes Wiedersich wrote     Just use a grey by dotting watermark for black text  merge the layers    and it will    be rather difficult to remove the watermark    I did not merge the layers before sending it to them  Problematic   Difficult to judge  since I somehow lost track of what exactly you tried to achieve and what is the nature of the document   If you are simply afraid  that someone would use this document as her his own work you could watermark the pdf and convert it to a low resolution bitmap  as others have already suggested   If the document was later misused  you could just show your nice  high quality printout without watermarks to prove that you are the real author   Another way might be to hand out that bad quality printout on some special paper  either coloured or with rules and keep the pdf version to yourself  It will be about as difficult to retype recreate such a document from paper as from retyping it from screen  which was your first choice  disallow printing  allow screen viewing    I think you might have gotten better replies in shorter time  if you had been more explicit and clear about what you try to achieve        Johannes  In questions of science  the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual      Galileo Galilei  physicist and astronomer                  BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux   iEYEARECAAYFAkvOssIACgkQC NzPRl qEVFsgCfVRlKyYWkvwPViEKl j mWOVj  GUAn knZWl   ciugK HRDfXVmKgI      lF      END PGP SIGNATURE            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
