This little domain went to China    The RIAA continues to amaze me     Everyone might want to grok the news yahoo has       And if you re really bored  go ahead and read the papers that were filed by the RIAA against the major backbone providers       So it looks like the RIAA is getting bored with its usual tack of suing the peer to peer services  and is instead using the DMCA to sue ISPs and backbones into compliance     They want said backbones to block the ip address of the listen ever com server due to listen ever s alleged infringement of copyright   To quote the Motion that the RIAA issued    Plaintiffs request that the Court issue a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to block communication to and from Listen ever s servers that travel through Defendants  backbone routing systems    At least according to the RIAA  probably for bonus terror tactics   the Listen ever site is even more formidable than that bane of p p goodness  Napster  due to the fact that its on a centralized server  out of their reach of RIAA DMCA control  its located in China   and because according to the RIAA it facilitates the downloading of entire albums  Apparently listen ever has a few other sites floating around  and the RIAA has been unsuccessful in getting any of them to voluntarily surrender service      Gotta love the RIAA for jumping into this lawsuit with the customer s interests in mind   How lawyers can write drivel along the lines of  if you dont stop these guys  we ll run out of money and we won t be able to supply you new music   just blows my mind  especially in this day and age    The RIAA has enough money to file inane lawsuits against backbone providers  but they don t have enough money to produce new artists   Something seems wrong here   Here s my problem   Say the RIAA wins in court  and the backbone providers comply    Their biggest hurdle is now accomplished  and one hell of a terrible precident is can be set    At least in the RIAA s case  I m sure once they get a Court mandated Ok for this particular site  they ll just go ahead  write their nice friendly lawyer letters  and demand that subsequent IP addresses also be blocked  as they too route to sites that are problematic to the RIAA   Even worse  the concept that other groups  the first that flashed into my little brain being the Scientologists  also decide that this is the way to go    If the RIAA prevails  they have record set  albiet in NY only  that can be pointed back to  and used in other cases  Eventually this will hit a large enough court that precident will set   and we have a very quiet  very non reported event occuring from then  on  the systematic C Ding of the Internet    Anything that violates the DMCA  given its takedown provisions  might now potentially fall prey to a Cease   Desist letter   Rather than appealing  the backbone providers will just agree    as they seem likely to do  provided a court order    Point being is that soon this won t take a court order   A nastygram will suffice and we ll wonder where all the new music information dissenting opinions  criticisms went   This is a scary road we re running down here    So nice to see that its still hush hush in the geek community   Whats more bizzare is some of the support    that the RIAA seemed to get    I m curious for instance  how Dave Farber got dragged into this         Dave  you still read FoRK       Save for one  lmp  com  which was listed as a redirect site in the court documents  has since gone down    Their website has a humorous little note    Lmp  will be closed and will never come back      Listen ever com is not responding  but i m not quite sure if thats due to backbone compliance or the site being overburdened       Declaration of Prof  David J  Farber     p        A very disgruntled   bitbitch
