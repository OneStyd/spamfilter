Daniel Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting     to move tURL    Date  Not supplied  Daniel Berlinger has noticed    that Mac software shops are starting to move to  OS X only development  This makes sense  for two reasons  First  most people  who pay for software have new computers  So while OS X may only have a small  fraction of the installed base  it has the majority of the population of people  who are opening their wallets  Second  if OS X isn t successful  the Mac is   over   It s not like System   is getting any more popular    Then again  there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right  business decision to develop software for the Macintosh  Developing for the Mac  is not a whole lot different than creating a web site  that only works on  Netscape    Given the market share of Macs     about       and the market share  of Netscape     about        that is not a silly comparison     Robb Beal wrote      Try this test  Go to a venture firm  angel  or big company  with a Mac OS X product concept prototype  Do they consider the fact that it s  a Mac application a net plus   No    Well  duh   Your product would have to  appeal to     times more Mac  users    as a percentage  than Windows users just  to break even  In other words  if your Windows product appeals to   in      Windows users  you have to appeal to    in     Mac users to make the same  amount of money    Now  you may want to make an  emotional  appeal to developing for the Mac   That s fine  If you like Macs and you re doing it for fun  more power to ya    But as long as we re talking  investment   you have to tell me why you re going  to get    times as many users  Maybe there s less competition in your category  on the Mac  maybe you re in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs  dominate  they don t  it just seems that way because the elite graphics people  in big American cities use Macs   maybe your product can t sell to mixed  environments unless it runs everywhere  But if you want to make an investment  in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you re going to overcome that  magic    multiplier
