Re  CVS report           Just cvs up ed and nowadays Catch up Unseen is   extremely   slow on          large       msgs  unseen sequences  Anybody else having this problem               I ll take the blame               The reason  I suspect  is that we re needlessly reading the  sequences file        multiple times because of other sequences   I need to make the code much        smarter about handling that file  but first I have a few other fish to fry in        my rather large patch that s on it s way                  No panic           I m all for cleaning things up before getting it optimized       Okay  this fix is now checked in     I m afraid it didn t help  It still seems to be slower than    month  ago  Maybe slightly faster than yeasterday  I m  still  seeing an   unseen countdown  in the log            Writing  home ander Mail lists l k  mh sequences          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has    msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          digits changed          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          lists l k has   msgs in unseen          FlistUnseenFolder lists l k          ok          Folder Change lists exmh  Msg Show cur                                                       Exmh workers mailing list
