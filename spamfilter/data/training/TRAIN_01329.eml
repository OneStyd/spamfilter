Re  lilo removal in squeeze  or   please test grub   On Sat     May                      EDT   William Pitcock wrote       After some discussion about lilo on  debian devel in IRC  it has pretty   much been determined that kernel sizes have crossed the line past where   lilo can reliably determine the payload size       This bug  can  be fixed  but not without a significant rewrite of the   way that lilo s stage  loader code works   Given that there is no active   upstream and that the Debian lilo package carries many patches for bug   fixes that are alleviated by standardizing on grub   this seems like the   best option for Debian       This means that users should  test grub  extensively  before Squeeze is   released so that any issues can be resolved now       As for removal  the following things need to be done           The release notes need to be updated to reflect that lilo is no   longer a bootloader option        The debian installer team needs to remove the lilo installer udeb        The ftpmasters need to remove lilo from unstable  which will be done   using the appropriate bug filing once the above steps are made         Users need to test grub  now   First of all  forgive me for cross posting  which is generally a no no  But if you can cross post  I can cross reply   Second  unless you reply to debian user  to which I am subscribed  please CC me   I am not subscribed to any of the other lists   I am not a Debian package maintainer or a Debian developer   I am just an ordinary system administrator   So I m sure that my opinion will not count for much   But I am opposed to the removal of lilo   Both grub legacy and grub pc use sectors on the hard disk outside of the master boot record  cylinder    head    sector      In other words they use cylinder    head    sector   and possibly subsequent sectors on cylinder   head     This breaks the design of the backup software that my employer uses   This backup software backs up the master boot record and all partitions  but since the extra sectors used by grub legacy and grub pc are outside the master boot record and are not part of any partition  they don t get backed up   Consequently  if we have a hard drive failure and restore from a backup  we have an unbootable machine   Lilo uses only the master boot record   A lilo booted machine can be backed up and restored with our existing backup software just fine   Given these requirements  I wouldn t use grub pc even if it were bug free and well documented    But neither is the case    As for the claims that kernels are too big now  I find that hard to believe  especially now that we have the large memory option available  The standard stock Debian kernel image file that I use for Squeeze  vmlinuz               is currently         bytes   Are you trying to tell me that there s no room for a  M kernel below the start of the EBDA   I am able to load  both  the kernel  and  the initial RAM filesystem below the EBDA  i e  the large memory option is not used  if I use MODULES dep instead of MODULES most in the initial RAM filesystem under Lenny   I ll bet I can do it with Squeeze too   I realize that lilo doesn t work for everyone  and I m not suggesting that it be the default bootloader  but to get rid of it entirely is unacceptable   As far as I know  it s the only bootloader that meets all of my requirements  and I will not voluntarily give it up   No doubt you will tell me that I am welcome to maintain it myself  Unfortunately  I do not have the requisite skills to do so   All I can do is to appeal in the name of reason that it not be dropped   Also  please excuse my ignorance  but what exactly is this  payload size  to which you refer   Is that the same thing as the size of the kernel   Or is it something else                   Stephen Powell                                  To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
