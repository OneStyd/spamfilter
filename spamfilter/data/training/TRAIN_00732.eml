is a funny thing to me   I hear about so many  people being super scared to give out their SS    Well folks   I can get your SS  for    cents   Give me a name and address  and about     of the time I can get the number     We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net  but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and  they take it out of our sight for    minutes   They could do  who knows what with the CC number   I once had a person  tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy  of her check to anyone  checks by fax  because then that  person  me  would have her account info and could write  a check out for thousands of dollars   I told her to just send  it to me then and she said that was OK   Then I asked her  to tell me what the difference was between the original check  and a fax copy   I told her to ask her lawyer that too   Never  heard back from her     The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info  it is  available in many places   Have a good day      Terry                 Yes  I believe that the risk is out there but minimal  However   we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions  Most  importantly  never give any personal information at a site  that is not secure  always look for the lock in thetask bar  or a Veri secure sign or others    Also  never leave your information stored at a site  I put  in my credit information in each time instead of having  an account in standing  a little more time but less risks  involved  Of course  I mostly shop at my own Internet  mall and I know how safe it is there  credit card info is  deleted in a matter of seconds  Overall  I believe the web  to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier      Catherine F                     Yes  I had phenomena for   weeks and did not realize that  my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner  was in a bad car accident   I had a full service account    My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address  went unprotected   A Russian stepped in  paid the fees   and  promptly assigned my    address to a porn shop   Thus  I lost   years of building  up  st place rankings on    Search Engines and  nd place  on   more   This set me back about    months  I believe I  lost a minimum of              I have also been hit with viruses about    times   The first  time I lost almost   months of work   Now  I back up often  enough to not to lose so much time   This is also Internet  theft   These people are nothing but out and out criminals  and should spend years behind bars    Customers are well protected from credit card theft   however  merchants can lose a lot of money   I sell only by  purchase order and certified or registered company checks      Peter S
