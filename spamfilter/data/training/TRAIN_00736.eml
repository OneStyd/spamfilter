TRAMP UpdateURL    Date            T                Finally finished up  most of  TRAMP  my RDF interface for Python   If you don t  use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry      New in this version  RDF library abstraction  because rdflib s organization  currently sucks   write values in addition to reading  and unit tests  all with  that old TRAMP flavor you ve come to know and love      But wait   it also comes with an entire page of explanation advertisement     if you re not already convinced         RDF XML got you down  Tired of having to go through contortions to deal      with data  Want to write Python and be standards compatible at the same      time  Need a module to implement the psuedo code you had on your slides        TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems      Enjoy  and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me    why it s called TRAMP               mailto
