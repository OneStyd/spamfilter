Re  Patch to complete a change   Done     Robert Elz said     I suspect that as part of Chris  set of changes  he cleaned up the    use of the variable that was named  L  in FtocCommit  in ftoc tcl      Its name got changed from L to lineno        But there s one reference of  L left    That causes tracebacks if    you attempt to use  link  with the current CVS version of exmh         I guess that most of us don t use  link  very often     I noticed it    last week  but only got time to look and see why today         If someone with the ability to commit to the CVS repository would    apply the following patch  to lib ftoc tcl  that would be nice      It works    and is trivial  and you could perhaps just apply it by    making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and    applying it   there s only one instance of  L in the file  that    should be changed to  lineno         kre                ftoc tcl PREV Wed Aug                         ftoc tcl Tue Sep                                                                       incr ftoc numMsgs            else            FtocUnmarkInner  L          FtocUnmarkInner  lineno             incr ftoc changed                       if   delmsgs                      Exmh                   Brent Welch Software Architect  Panasas Inc Pioneering the World s Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network                                                        Exmh users mailing list
