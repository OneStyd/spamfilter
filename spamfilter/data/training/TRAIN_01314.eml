getting inetd to run leafnode via IPv Some time ago  my slrn stopped being able to talk to my local news server  and I m just now trying to troubleshoot it   I suspect this has a really obvious answer  but because I m not at all familiar with IPv   I m not seeing it   I m running sid  mostly up to date   Apparently  the problem is that inetd has leafnode listening on IPv   but not on IPv    I think I need to either get slrn to work with IPv   or get leafnode listening on IPv    Actually I d like to know how to do both   I d very much appreciate any pointers you can give me      netstat  l   grep nntp  tcp                      nntp                      LISTEN     telnet         Trying        Connected to      Escape character is            Leafnode NNTP Daemon  version        running at ip  localhost  my fqdn  a b org    telnet localhost      Trying               telnet  Unable to connect to remote host  Connection refused  This is surprising  because I thought you had to specifically tell inetd to use IPv    My inetd conf has this line   nntp stream tcp nowait news  usr sbin tcpd  usr sbin leafnode      but neither loosening my  etc hosts   files nor removing tcpd from the loop seems to help   I m a total newb regarding IPv    Currently my environment has   NNTPSERVER localhost     which some time ago allowed slrn to read from the local news server   Changing to   NNTPSERVER    does not satisfy slrn   Connecting to host       Failed to resolve  Any suggestions       monique       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
