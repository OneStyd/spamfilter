Re  Safely delete     pass  file with a Java application On    mai       at        Matev C  BE Markovi C   D wrote     Since I am still an amateur in the Java language  I want to practice   as much as possible  Not long ago I came along with an idea  that I   want to write a application  Swing application   from which one will   be able to choose a file and safely delete it  e g  rename delete    overwrite    times  possibly less    I m not really sure if this is guarateed to work on all Java   implementations  but you could try to open the file for random access        then write random data to the entire contents of the file before you   delete  It might even work if you first open  then delete  before   writing random data if you prefer that      But it might be that you are better off finding a command line tool that   handles the secure deletion for you  and create a Swing app that   delegates the heavy lifting to the command line tool  Low level file   system access isn t really one of Java s strong points  as its foucs has   always been being cross platform  Java   s NIO   functionality might fix   some of these issues though      Best regards         Harald K                                                   Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
