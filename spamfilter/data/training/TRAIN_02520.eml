Re  Middle button click brokenJust when you said that you  have the same   I thought this was the full setup  that is Gnome included  Anyway  it does not matter  I tried other window managers in the problematic machine  other user accounts too  and always strange behavior with the middle click  It seemed to be deeply rooted somewhere in the system  As a last resort  I rebooted the machine  and    problem solved   Should we reboot after updating X     Thanks  Pierre           Original Message      From  Harald Hanche Olsen   To    Cc       Sent  Sun  April                  PM Subject  Re  Middle button click broken    Pierre Baguis       I am wondering if Gnome is to blame  but then Harald had not issues    Oh  wait  I don t use Gnome  I don t think I said I did  or at least I did not mean to imply it  Of course  you could try switching back to quartz wm and see if the problem persists     Harald                                                            Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  X   users mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
