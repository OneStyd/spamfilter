applied with the skype s solution to sol  ve           our             problem                                Hi                      I had the same problem with kdm  but no problem with gdm                      cheers                     Klaus                     Hi  Installing gdm did not do the trick                      You must uninstall the kdm service first and select in the session         selector of gdm  kde   If you don t select the session type  get so  me         errors                        I uninstalled kdm and selected kde as a session but I got the same        message telling me that my session lasted lower than   s and bla bla                                     When doing startx as a normal user from console I get some errors          like  xkb could not initialize  and  Xinit  no such file or direct  ory  and           Xinit  Could not connect to xserver                               Have you stopped the kdm first                        Yes I did stop kdm when I tried that  The strange thing is that if I        login as root from console and do a startx then a kde session starts        normally  If I do that as a normal user I get the errors                      Can you paste the errors                  When trying to login with gdm it has an option to view the       xsession errors file  The error is mkdtmp  private folder browsing       something like that  P   Permission denied            When I was using kdm and did a cat on the same file the second line ju  st      showed  Permission denied            I checked the  Xauthority file and did chown to my user               I remember that first time I try to execute the startx with my user I g  et     some errors but not with root  The problem was that the  tmp directory     doesn t have permissions to write with my user          The correct permissions are              cd  tmp         ls  ld         drwxrwxrwt    root root                                  Could you check it                                                      Some friend told me to purge kde and reinstall it  I don t think          this will help  Do you think I should give it a try                                     I tried that with no success                     If that didn t help you I will not bother                 J                              Well yesterday before I sent the list an email I used google to find    anything that would help  I found someone reporting that the permissions   in     tmp and  var tmp could be the problem  I checked both  Everything seeme  d    fine  S  I will check again  just in case             Check the sticky bit   is the important think      I think is      chmod        tmp   chmod        var tmp    I have just remember that I deleted all contents of  tmp because some files has the wrong permissions      I have slow remembering memory   D     Un saludo   Daniel Sutil      On Wed  Apr         at      PM  Daniel S  util   lt  daniel      gt   wrote
