Re   ILUG  Installing lilo on another disk On Tue  Jul          at         PM       or so it is rumoured hereabouts   Niall O Broin thought    I m installing warm standby disks on a number of boxes  These disks will be   the same size  sometimes bigger  than the main disk  The idea is that every   night I ll rsync the partitions on the main disk to the standby disk so that   in the case of disaster  the first port of call  before the tapes  is the   standby disk   We did consider running Linux md RAID on the disks but RAID   gives you no protection against slips of the finger       So  in the event of finger slips we can mount the relevant partition and   retrieve the banjaxed file  In the case of a disk crash  the plan is that   we ll put the standby disk in place of the main disk and the workstation   will be back up ASAP  Then we can deal with replacing the disk without the   pressure of a broken box on our back       However  I m stumped as to how to install LILO on the backup disk  Let s say   the master disk is  dev hda and the backup disk is  dev hdb  lilo conf   currently looks like this       boot       dev hda   change rules   reset   read only   menu scheme   Wg kw Wg Wg   lba     prompt   timeout        message    boot message        image     boot vmlinuz     label    linux     root      dev hda      vga              initrd    boot initrd            There are a couple more boot stanzas  but they re not germane  As you can   see    is on  dev hda  and  boot is on  dev hda   So if for instance I had   booted from a CD and wanted to re install LILO on this disk I d do something   like      mount  dev hda   mnt   mount  dev hda   mnt boot   lilo  r  mnt      which is OK because I m installing lilo on  dev hda and I want it to boot   from  dev hda so it ll plug in all the right numbers       However  in the case of the standby disk  I ll have to do something like      mount  dev hdb   mnt   mount  dev hdb   mnt boot   lilo  r  mnt      But I m obviously going to have to do something different here because I   want to install onto  dev hdb in such a way that the disk will boot when it   becomes  dev hda after a disaster  like the one I had this morning         shutting the stable door was on the to do list  but the bloody horse decided   to do a bunk early   The machine already has its spare disk   just hadn t   yet been used          I thought perhaps I should just do   lilo  b  dev hdb  r  mnt  but I think   that  b is analogous to the boot keyword in lilo conf  Or will this just   work automagically    i e  boot    dev hda tells lilo what numbers to poke   where  and it figures out where the disk is from the  r     from the Hard Disk Upgrade Mini HOWTO       Prepare LILO to boot the new disk      Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this       We re  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk s Master Boot    Record  MBR   this seems to be the most common configuration  You want    to  install  LILO  on  what s  presently the second hard disk but will    become the first hard disk      Edit the file  new disk etc lilo conf as follows           disk  dev hdb bios  x           Tell LILO to treat the second
