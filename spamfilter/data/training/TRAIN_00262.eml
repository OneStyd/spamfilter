CERT Advisory CA         Vulnerability in PHP       BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE       CERT Advisory CA         Vulnerability in PHP     Original release date  July             Last revised        Source  CERT CC     A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file   Systems Affected         Systems running PHP versions       or        Overview     A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP  This vulnerability could    be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP    and or the web server   I  Description     PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use  For more    information about PHP  see                  The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for    handling  file uploads  specifically multipart form data  By sending a    specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server  an attacker can    corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP  Specifically  an    intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be    freed   In  most  cases  an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or    the  web  server  Under some circumstances  an intruder may be able to    take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the    privileges of the web server      You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some    implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the    execution  of  arbitrary  code   However  because PHP utilizes its own    memory  management  system   the  implementation of malloc and free is    irrelevant to this problem      Stefan  Esser  of  e matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot    execute   code   on   x     systems    However   we  encourage  system    administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x    systems  as well to guard    against denial of service attacks and as yet unknown attack techniques    that may permit the execution of code on x   architectures      This  vulnerability  was discovered by e matters GmbH and is described    in  detail  in  their  advisory   The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an    advisory   A list of vendors contacted by the CERT CC and their status    regarding this vulnerability is available in VU             Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP         and            e matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older    versions  of  PHP   If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP  we    encourage you to review       II  Impact     A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system     An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x   architectures due    to  the way the stack is structured  However  an attacker can leverage    this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and or the web server running on an    x   architecture   III  Solution  Apply a patch from your vendor     Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory     As  vendors report new information to the CERT CC  we will update this    section  and note the changes in our revision history  If a particular    vendor  is  not  listed  below   we  have not received their comments     Please contact your vendor directly   Upgrade to the latest version of PHP     If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor  upgrade to version            Deny POST requests     Until  patches  or an update can be applied  you may wish to deny POST    requests   The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security    Advisory        If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on      HTTP POST input from user agents  it is often possible to deny POST      requests on the web server        In  the  Apache  web server  for example  this is possible with the      following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a      top level  htaccess file                  Order deny allow         Deny from all              Note  that an existing configuration and or  htaccess file may have      parameters contradicting the example given above   Disable vulnerable service     Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches  you may wish to disable PHP     As a best practice  the CERT CC recommends disabling all services that    are not explicitly required  Before deciding to disable PHP  carefully    consider your service requirements   Appendix A    Vendor Information     This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this    advisory   As  vendors  report new information to the CERT CC  we will    update this section and note the changes in our revision history  If a    particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below  we have not received their    comments   Apple Computer Inc             Mac  OS  X
