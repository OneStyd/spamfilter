Re  Asynchronous load fail with i    build in a cmd line tool      If I try to create my QTMovie object on a secondary thread  I get the    following exception                               QTAsyncLoadCmdLine            An uncaught    exception was raised                              QTAsyncLoadCmdLine            QTMovie QuickTime    class must be initialized on the main thread                So it s seem s to be impossible to make asynchronous loading on a    secondary thread          I would read that exception as saying that the QTMovie class cannot be initialized on a secondary thread  not that a QTMovie object cannot be initialized on a secondary thread   Try calling  QTMovie class  on the main thread before creating a QTMovie instance on a thread   No way  the exception is not anymore raised but the movie doesn t load to full completion   I think I must try with QuickTime C API   Christophe                                                  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
