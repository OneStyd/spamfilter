Re  Nil messaging statement in  Cocoa Fundimentals Guide   misleading On Sun  May          at      PM  John Engelhart   wrote    If you believe otherwise  show your work   C  A Otherwise  the point is s  ettled   Fact  the C standard does not say anything about machine level calling conventions   Fact  the C standard does not address the behavior which results when the call site of a function sees a prototype whose return type differs from the return type present at the definition of the function   Conclusion  a conforming C compiler could use completely different techniques for returning  int  and  long    Conclusion  in such an ABI  machine level code which arranges for callers to see an  int  return value of   could easily be written such that a caller which expects  long  to see something other than zero   Conclusion  if you re paranoid about portability  you can t assume that messages to nil with a  long  return type will return    with a strict reading of Apple s guarantees   And note that absolutely nothing in the above is even slightly related to integer type sizes  type conversions  casts  promotions  the bit level representation of the NULL pointer  or any other such things  so any discussion of them in this context is utterly pointless   Mike                                                  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Objc language mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
