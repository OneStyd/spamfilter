Oh ma gawd   funny site of the day   This is for those that have interacted with D Winer   Dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around   You re supposed to just shut up and take it                    Who s the real monster    It seems good Ol  Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him   It seems Ben  Kevin and Bill are making too strong a case   So here we Dave s attempt to fool you into thinking they re some sort of monsters  violent ones no less   Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters  who will stoop to any level to get their way   Yeah sure Dave  whatever you need to believe   The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving RSS in general   Each with their own brand of attitude  to be sure  but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward   How is that being monstrous   Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public s perception of them   If you haven t already  contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness                       AM   Discuss    Dave deflects what he can t take the time to understand   It s really quite pitiful   When normal people don t understand something they usually try learning about it   They read up  ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it   This before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools   What Dave does is just the opposite   Posts a link to something he doesn t understand Get s a bunch of e mail from people who do understand it Derides the idea as being  too much trouble  and blogs it  Expects others to do research for him Abuses anyone who tries to help him Pontificates  incorrectly  about only part of the issue Realizes he s been a fool but refuses to correct himself Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy Tries making the educated people look like fools  Sends private e mails to them trying to scare them off  Exposes any private e mail they write  out of context  Deflects and runs off to some new topic  repeats from    His continued diatribes about RSS     and it s use of RDF reveal this to be true   Dave doesn t get the idea of the semantic web   He d rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying   One reader wrote to us with a good analogy    It s like that movie The Poseidon Adventure   Dave s like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow   I don t know about you but I d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room  The ship s fucking sinking and I don t want to be following the idiot    Dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around   You re supposed to just shut up and take it   After all  why would good ol  Uncle Dave want to hurt you   It s all about love  right   To hell with asking you if you want to get shafted   And if you dare complain  he savages you   Then he tries to make everyone think you re the one causing all the trouble   We ve news for you Dave  we re wise to your tactics and we re talking amongst ourselves about it   We re routing around you damaging behavoir  That s where we re coming from   If you have an example of how you ve tried to help Dave  please drop us an e mail about it   We ll keep it strictly confidential of course   Send it along to                        AM   Discuss     Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig      The trouble is  you get dirty and the pig seems to like it   Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it s fundamentally impossible   His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web developers are doing a terrible job   In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering  that guy is an idiot      The zaphodim  however  are veteran pig wrestlers   If you ve got a similar tale from the mud pit  be sure to drop us a line at                         PM   Discuss    response      Aha  Some backing down by the whining one    It would appear the  dictator release  strategy that Dave s been trying on his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support   I m going to push back the caveat removing on the     spec by    hours  Still have work to do on the sample file  I want to look into the RFC for time date specs  and get started on the Radio implementation of      I have to prepare for Seybold tomorrow  and I want to a little memorial for       A busy few days for a guy still recovering  Also  it would be great if people who make content tools could review the     spec and see if there are any deal stoppers   Hell yeah there are deal stoppers  like nobody wants it nor will they use it   The poor Radio customers   The poor Salon blog users   They re going to be dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use   So with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage     Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected   Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card   What utter fucking nonsense   This past weekend  the blogosphere excoriates him for his  blame America  bullshit   Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of RSS   Now he s trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he s still recovering   Uh  Dave  if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights   We ll still kick your ass regardless   That s what years of your abusing people has gotten you Dave   No sympathy anymore  none whatsoever                      PM   Discuss     Dave is Scary on       Posted on Scripting News on              Note  During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News  I ll be in SF at Seybold  leading a discussion on Web Services for Publishing with people from Amazon  Apple  Google and Jake Savin of UserLand  I may be able to update my Radio weblog  but only if there s something really important to report  So best wishes for a happy and safe       What kind of asshole wishes people a happy                   Obviously someone who doesn t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy                      AM   Discuss     Yeow and we though we were harsh    Wow  apparently Dave s sticking his neck out quite far these days   Craig Schamp practically keel hauls him with this one   He wraps it up with   The man seems to show over and over that he s nothing more than a whining buffoon  Give that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring   Related links over at PhotoDude  Richard Bennett  Andrea Harris  Reid Stott  Jeff Jarvis  Ipse Dixit  and the Fat Guy                      PM   Discuss     RSS      code name  Hitler    If Dave tries to steamroll RSS     through without formal community consensus  here now we call it the  Hitler  release of        No objections    No  he means  No objections I choose to hear    Dave is simply not listening   People are objecting all over                       AM   Discuss     Referral log funnies   Every now and then we check the referral logs to see what s pointing back to us   We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search                      PM   Discuss     Luserland Attempts to Trademark  RSS    Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt  Scripting News is full of examples   So we found it surprising  as did many others  when Luserland software tried to patent the term  RSS  back in       Here s the patent application      This was apparently just between the start of the RSS     development efforts  and the publication of the specification  Winer knew about the RSS     stuff   indeed  he complained about it bitterly at the time   Could Dave be any more transparent                 Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do    A good quote from before he filed the patent application   Tim O Reilly says patents are OK  he s just against stupid patents  In the spirit of Touch of Grey  Tim man  patents are lock in of the worst kind  There s no way to route around them                    AM   Discuss     When s a Permalink not a Permalink    When Dave writes an item  then removes it            The permalink links to nothing at that point  So apparently the  perma   part in permalink is permanent  For everyone except Dave  Too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this                                PM   Discuss
