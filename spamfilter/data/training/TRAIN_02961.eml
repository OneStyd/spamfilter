StreamCast Networks  developers of the popular Morpheus peer to peer  P P  file sharing software  filed briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution of the software does not violate copyright law   Morpheus is a popular file sharing application based on the decentralized Gnutella P P networking protocol   In their briefs seeking summary judgment  attorneys from the Electronic Frontier Foundation  EFF  and the law firm of Brobeck  Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software   Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis Ian  who believes that peer to peer software represents important new opportunities for artists   On October             of the world s largest entertainment companies sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its product

Campaign for Audiovisual Free Expression  CAFE   which oversees projects such as the Open Audio License  CAFE empowers the creative community in cyberspace by protecting the public s access to and use of audiovisual technologies   The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to help artists share music more directly with their fans  without sacrificing recognition for their creativity  The OAL encourages collaboration  providing artists with an alternative to a business model strictly driven by profit  Based on the open source and free software initiatives for software development  the OAL encourages artists to share with one another and their fans  Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their work  On the contrary  the OAL permits artists to share single tracks or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without relying on intermediaries  EFF encourages new models of music distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves  The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for packaging and distributing music  which is where record companies currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists  EFF is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works   When  Saturday
