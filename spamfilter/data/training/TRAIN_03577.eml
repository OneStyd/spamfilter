 ILUG  cdrecord            hard lockHi all  I ve run into a fairly intractable  for me  problem  and was wondering if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it   I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system  I have a Ricoh     a ide cd rewriter  which I use using cdrecord and the scsi over ide kernel modules   I was running kernel        until probably last weekend when I noticed        was out   Downloaded patch and installed new kernel with no real problems   This morning I went to burn a CDROM  and the system locked hard   Rebooting into        allowed cdburning to work fine   This problem is very reproducible  on my system at least   the cdrecord command I was using was     cdrecord  v speed   blank fast dev        data bak iso The blanking appears to go ok  but when it tries to write data  it just locks up the entire system  can t ping it from outside even    AFAICS  the system just stops   Hard reset is only way back in  and when it does reboot  I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles   var log messages  var log kern log  var log syslog  at any rate   cdrecord  scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo scsi devices  my cdr drive and my cdrw   The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking   I tried upgrading to        pre  ac   on assumption that if there was a kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches   but it gives the same error   I also downloaded and compiled the source for cdrecord         and installed it instead of the debian package  i was wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used which maybe would cause the problem   and still the problem persisted   Anyway  I m completely stumped   Google searching has not done me much good  and I m a little bit lost   What I d like to know is a   How to fix the problem     b   Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem   The severity     of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem  but I m     not very knowledgeable on these things  c   Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list  If     this is an appropriate course of action  are there any tips  beyond     the guidelines on kernel org    Like I said  I m lost on this one  so any info is very gratefully received  mick     Michael Conry   Ph                  Web    Key fingerprint        B          C   A     CB      B        DE    C      Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
