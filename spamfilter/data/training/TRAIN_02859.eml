Re  debian on a raid    TB  issues   Hi  maybe OT but  I m trying to install debian lenny on a raid  with    TB  OS sees one big sda with  TB  I can particion  boot    and swap   but it only recognize   GB instead the  TB available  Is this   because   the partition in booteable  Can I install debian OS  on this hdd   with   these   partitions and use the rest for LVM  Thanks in advance       Seriously consider using Raid    If you use Raid   then the probability of an unrecoverable read error  URE  occurring while rebuilding the  TB of data is IMO a little too high  With Raid   it would require   URE s that happen to be located in the same raid segment on both disks   the odds of that are extremely low   my  c   tim       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
