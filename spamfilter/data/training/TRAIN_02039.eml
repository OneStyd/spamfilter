Re  libc  upgrade lenny to squeeze failed  now dpkg is brokenOn                         Chris Austin wrote     I was required to upgrade libc  from lenny to squeeze in order to meet   dependencies to install a package from unstable  but the libc  upgrade   failed because libc bin was not installed   How could this happen  given that libc  depends on libc bin     Now dpkg is broken   I   tried a manual reinstall of the lenny libc   as suggested in another   thread on this list  but it did not work   The result was     debian  home chris  dpkg  i libc        lenny  i    deb   dpkg   ldconfig  not found on PATH    dpkg    expected program s  not found on PATH    NB  root s PATH should usually contain  usr local sbin   usr sbin and  sbin      How can this be fixed   Use the    force bad path  option  see  dpkg   force help       And shouldn t there be a big warning that trying to upgrade libc  can    break dpkg  on the Debian website page for libc    There is  actually this holds for any package                If you are running Debian  it is strongly suggested to use a package   manager like aptitude or synaptic to download and install packages    instead of doing so manually via this website         Follow this advice and do not use dpkg directly if you don t know what you re doing   Especially not for required packages   Sven       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
