Re  The Curse of India s SocialismI think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with  Bureaucracy   Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not  exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency   Just try starting a telephone company in the US or  even worse   Canada   It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own   Permit Rajs  at the FCC  PUC  and PTTs  or  in the decidedly more  socialist leaning Canada  Industry Canada and the CRTC    Yet  despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing  as  well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC  SEC  and IRS  the  executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment  community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars   They  finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz    laying off  hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down   So   tell me again   how are we better off    Ian    On Tuesday  August           at       PM  John Hall wrote     The Mystery of Capital  Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails   Everywhere Else    by Hernando De Soto      Is something I m reading now      My impression is that France is not anywhere near the  Permit Raj    nightmare that India is  and became    Nor has its market been closed   like India s has      But De Soto s work is perhaps just as important or more so   He hasn t   dealt specifically with India  but I recall examples from Peru    Philippines  and Egypt   In Lima  his team took over a year  I think it   was    working   hr days to legally register a   person company      In the   Philippines  getting legal title can take    years   In Egypt     about       of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially   illegal      India hasn t been helped by its socialism   Socialism has certainly   helped strangle the country in permits   But perhaps De Soto is right   that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the   legal  official property system      Putting most of the people in the property system was something    the west   only finished about     years ago  or Japan did    years ago   It    wasn t   easy  but we live in a society that doesn t even remember we did it              Original Message         From     mailto    On Behalf Of   Robert    Harley    Sent  Tuesday  August                AM    To       Subject  Re  The Curse of India s Socialism       RAH quoted      Indians are not poor because there are too many of them  they are   poor     because there are too many regulations and too much government    intervention        even today  a decade after reforms were begun  India s greatest    problems     arise from a political culture guided by socialist instincts on the   one     hand and an imbedded legal obligation on the other hand        Nice theory and all  but s India France g and the statements hold just    as true  yet France is     in the UN s HDI ranking  not                 Since all parties must stand for socialism  no party espouses     classical liberalism       I m not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution    for countries in real difficulty   See Joseph Stiglitz  Nobel for    Economics  on the FMI s failed remedies   Of course googling on     Stiglitz FMI  only brings up links in Spanish and French   I guess    that variety of spin is non grata in many anglo circles           R
