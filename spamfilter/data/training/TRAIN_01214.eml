Compositing two moviesI need to play two movies in sync  compositing them in a custom way   One approach I came up with is to put the movies in QTMovieLayers  Core  Animation   and then I can use a Core Image filter for the compositing     Does that sound reasonable  or is there another approach that is  likely to perform significantly better         James W  Walker  Innoventive Software LLC                                                        Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
