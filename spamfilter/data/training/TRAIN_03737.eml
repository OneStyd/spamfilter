Re  Questions about RAID  Mark Allums put forth on                 PM     For DIY  always pair those drives   Consider RAID     RAID     RAID       etc   Alas  that doubles the number of drives  and intensely decreases   the MTBF  which is the whole outcome you want to avoid   This is my preferred mdadm   drive setup for a light office server or home media vanity server   Some minor setup details are omitted from the diagram to keep it simple  such as the fact that  boot is a mirrored    MB partition set and that there are two non mirrored  GB swap partitions     and  var are mirrored partitions in the remaining first   GB   These sizes are arbitrary  and can be seasoned to taste   I find these sizes work fairly well for a non GUI Debian server   md raid    x    GB    K rpm SATAII drives    mirror    mirror                                                                      boot         boot       swap         swap                G                var     G    var                                                         home         home        home         home       samba        samba       samba        samba     other        other       other        other                                                                                                                                                                                                                RAID             GB NET  For approximately the same    outlay one could simply mirror two  TB    K rpm drives and have the same usable space and a little less power draw   The   drive RAID    setup will yield better read and write performance due to the striping  especially under a multiuser workload  and especially for IMAP serving of large mailboxen   For a small medium office server running say Postfix Dovecot Samba lighty Roundcube webmail  a small intranet etc  the   drive setup would yield significantly better performance than the higher capacity   drive setup   Using Newegg s prices  each solution will run a little below or above        This   drive RAID    makes for a nice little inexpensive and speedy setup   TB of user space may not seem like much given the capacity of today s drives  but most small medium offices won t come close to using that much space for a number of years  assuming you have sane email attachment policies       Stan       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
