Re  Nil messaging statement in  Cocoa Fundimentals Guide   misleading On Fri  May          at      AM  John Engelhart   wrote    On Thu  May          at      PM  Quincey Morris     wrote        On May           at        Greg Parker wrote           The Objective C Programming Language  includes a section that documen  ts      the well defined nil return types  Other documentation should point ba  ck to      that        Interestingly  the section you refer to includes the following statement             If the method returns any pointer type  any integer scalar of size le  ss      than or equal to sizeof void    a float  a double  a long double  or a   long      long  then a message sent to nil returns           This makes me wonder what the answer is for an integer scalar of size     greater  than sizeof void   that isn t a long long              Arithmetic operands      The rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int    which shall be greater than the rank of int  which shall be greater than   the   rank of short int  which shall be greater than the rank of signed char    The fact that the documentation explicitly calls out  long long  means th  at   the statement  any integer scalar of size less than or equal to   sizeof void    is redundant because the  long long  type is  by definitio  n    the largest of the  standard integer types    There is no guarantee that  void   is the same size as  any  of the standard integer types           For example  if the architecture has sizeof long    sizeof void    the    above definition would rule out long  but rule in long long  Odd      Nope   C  A By definition  long is a subset of long long          Types      For any two integer types with the same signedness and different integ  er   conversion rank  see           the range of values of the type with small  er   integer conversion rank is a subrange of the values of the other type   That  in no way  means that  long  cannot be larger than  void    That said  I do believe that the intent is that all of the standard integer types can be assumed to be zero when returned from a message sent to nil  even if the wording leaves the potential for a gap on unusual architectures  such as where long is larger than void            Clark S  Cox III                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Objc language mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
