Re  KDE       upgrade eats     MB of  homeOn Wed  May          at         AM        Richard Hartmann wrote         Disable  kres migrator    Or at least add a debconf option to      kdepim runtime presenting the option of running kres migrator by default      or disabling it       Did you do any research as to what the longer term implications   of foregoing this might be  I am not saying there are any  I   honestly don t know   There shouldn t be any long term implications as long as the old KResource code still exists   I m assuming it s being deprecated as of KDE      but I d be surprised if it s removed in KDE      especially since delaying migration is an official recommendation   Once the DB mess is sorted out  KDE        one can manually migrate the data by running  kres migrator    I actually did this accidentally   The migrator  might  also run if we remove the configuration bit  but I ve not tried         Add a warning dialog during kdepim runtime upgrade stating that      kres migrator will run by default and potentially consume a large amount      of per user disk space  unless migration is manually disabled by the      above command       Personally  I would like to see such a warning  but I am not sure if   that is acceptable by Debian s standards  apt listchanges exists for   a reason   It extends beyond just a change in package behavior  it s a non reversible and potentially aggravating alteration to user data   I ve seen similar warnings before  most recently to rebuild OpenOffice org  rdb files due to possible corruption         Reduce the default size of the InnoDB transaction logs in the Akonadi      per user MySQL configuration       Seems like the best bet to me  If need be  the file size could be adapted   automagically  But that functionality would be in     at the earliest unless   it s patched downstream   Forgot to mention before  apparently there s an Innodb log waits counter that increments when you have write bursts that exceed the REDO log size  It can be used for feedback to increase the log size if needed   Perhaps something to suggest manually doing in NEWS     Also  what about  root   Should have same problem  if one runs a KDE desktop as root  which I do not        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
