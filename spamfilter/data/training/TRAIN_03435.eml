Re  My brain hurtsMore than a dozen jokes   thanks guys and girls   plus some anti French abuse from the usual suspect    Well my brain doesn t hurt so much any more  and it was well worth it  I ve now got an even faster method for elliptic curve point counting  both pratically and asymptotically   It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O n        eps    or O n    eps   with precomputation   Before the best methods took O n    eps   without precomputation  or O n        eps   with it  The precomputation is done once per field  not per curve  and takes time O n    eps     Here eps is an arbitrarily small number  hiding some logarithmic factors   After lifting  you compute a norm in time O n        eps   to get the number of points on the curve   Here s an example over a      bit field  without precomputation  using a   GHz Pentium III                                                                                      ecpc   d       j  x    INFO                                                                        INFO             ECPC  Elliptic Curve Point Counting  made easy             INFO             v        c  ArgoTech       All rights reserved             INFO                                                                              INFO  Picked field polynomial   x    x       INFO  Starting ECPC on j    x       INFO  Done after        seconds  INFO  Checking    OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK       CURVE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         INFO    curve processed  INFO  Bye                                                                                   L r    Rob                              Robert                                                       Software Development                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ArgoTech
