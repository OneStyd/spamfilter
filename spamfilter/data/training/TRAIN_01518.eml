Re  Vnc serverIl                   Andrew Lapham ha scritto    Hello all      I m new to debian    days  but have been using Linux for a while  Anyway my   problem is with Vnc server      Yesterday I set up my  home  Vnc xstartup to include gnome session and I   commented terminal emulator  And I remoted in no problem  I forget if I used   vnvserver or Vnc server      Today I turned on the pc and ran the server and all I get is a grey screen   and a mouse  I tried vncserver and Vnc server  Any ideas       Sorry for the case spelling errors this was composed on my phone      I ran into a similar issue some time ago  and found the solution on a  vnc mailing list  in case you have further problems   If you closed your vnc session by  logging out   what happens is that  your session  gnome  is no longer active  but vnc is not concerned   The workaround that was suggested to me is to  not  have vncstartup exec  the session  but rather launch a session and cleanup afterwards  ie    wrong  exec gnome session    right gnome session vncserver  kill  DISPLAY  If you grok the shell you ll probably use the trap command to make sure  that cleanup is done no matter what  but that s just a detail  good luck       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
