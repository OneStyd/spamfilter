Re  Fw  Re  When are we going to get   making ALSA rpms Thanks for this information   I gave Alsa a try  couldn t figure out how to enable digital out  although I m sure if I put enough time into it  could have gotten it working   Also when playing mp s in analog mode  every time I switched between mp s there was a bit of static   Noticed a new distribution geared towards audio applications  AGNULA    uses Alsa as well   Seems though the latest open source emu  k  drivers  SBLive       work fair enough   Anyone else experience these problems with Alsa   Are there alot of people on this list using Alsa   Regards   Lance  On Sat             at        Angles Puglisi wrote    FYI  This is how I make my ALSA rpms     some people on the  null  list did not   realize it was pretty easy       btw  I do this lot since I ve upgraded from RH    to Limbo  to Limbo  to Null all in   a week  probably        forward   original mail      From  Angles Puglisi        Date                       pm     Subject Re  When are we going to get                  From   Angles  Puglisi     To      Subject  Re  When are we going to get       Date     Aug                          OK  I do this every time I update a kernel       The  st time I added ALSA  I tried a non root rpom build but the DEV things were not   made  Other than that  I bet you could do non root  The following can be scripted   easily          get  a  alsa drivers   b  alas lib  and  c  alsa utils tarballs  if upgrading the   kernel then you probably have them from your last install        unpack them somewhere       for each of them  go to the top directory of the unpacked tarball  and do      configure  then look in  I m going by memory  TOPDIR utils   you should see a spec   file there  Do this for the   tarballs and you get   spec files          put the source tarballs in SOURCES and the spec files in SPECS  go in order from   a  b  then c  doing     rpmbuild  ba SPECS alsa  X  spec  rpm  Uvh RPMS i    alsa  X  rpm          do that in order for the   spec files and you have just installed the alsa   drivers on your system  The  st time you do this you need to put the correct stuff   in your modules conf file  may take some research  then you get the alsa driver and   OSS compat capabilities  or you can choose not to use the OOS compat stuff       Script making the spec  then building and upgrading  as above  and you have    no sweat  ALSA       NOTE  the  null  rpmbuild did take some tweaking  it does a check for files in the   buildroot that you don t specify in your files section  In this case there is an   extra file  going by memory    include sys asound h   Add a line at the end on the    install  section of the spec file to delete that file and you are good to go       Gordon Messmer     wrote          On Fri             at        Matthias Saou wrote            Probably when Red Hat Linux gets a     kernel     Until then  a few places      provide good quality alsa packages  but indeed you still have to patch and      recompile your kernel         Not so   Alsa is build able independently of the kernel           Maybe some day I ll try ALSA  never done it yet   and that day you can      expect all needed packages to appear on freshrpms net            I d be interested in working with you on that if you want those    packages                                                                        Limbo list mailing list                    That s  angle  as in geometry              Linux One Stanza Tip  LOST                                Sub   Extracting lines X to Y in a text file         LOST       Use sed     Syntax    sed  n  X Yp    textout fil                                                                                                RPM List mailing list
