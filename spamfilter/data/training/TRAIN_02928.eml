Re  Fwd  Re  Kde        On Fri  May         at      PM  Lisi   wrote     No   that is the problem    A I loved KDE     x and have become quite sli  ck with   it   A KDE   is different   A I don t like it   A If I have to  in effect    change   DE  and go through the learning curve again  there is no reason why it wo  uld   have to be to KDE     A When the time comes that I cannot sensibly go on   using   KDE    I shall chose where I go next on the basis of what the options are   looking like at the time   A I can see little liklihood that that choice   will   be KDE     A I may even switch to a window manager without a DE  and chos  e   other ways of working  if that is the only way that I can avoid the glitz   that is now all the rage      How things look is very important to me   A I have problems with my eyes    and   how a thing looks can influence whether I can work on a thing for one min  ute    ten minutes or an hour      I have no problem with other people liking and wanting to use KDE     A I   have a   problem with their  in some cases  not allowing me the freedom  not  to u  se   it   A And I personally shall mourn the passing of KDE      The unexpected forced downgrade from KDE     to   in Sid actually ended up being a good thing for me   the loss of the ability to have a different background for each desktop was a KDE showstopper   So the forced downgrade prompted me to actually take a serious look at other desktop environments    And had that not happened  I would not be using Enlightenment on all my Linux boxes today   I have become quite enamored with Enlightenment  and now see no need whatsoever to go back to KDE or switch to Gnome   Granted  I will happily use various KDE and Gnome based tools if needed   That is no big deal   But E  with the Steampunk theme   is now my environment of choice       Only drawback so far I have encountered is the inability to change the background color on the desktop if the wallpaper image does not fill the entire screen   It can be a bit hard on the eyes with that harsh white background  but I think I can get used to it        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
