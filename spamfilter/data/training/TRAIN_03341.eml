Re  Kde          On         May              Jorge Gon alves wrote    Hello       First  thank you for the great distro that is Debian  one of the best       I would like to suggest you some way so that the users keep on using   the good old KDE     when they migrate to the upcoming Lenny   Others have probably pointed this out  Lenny has      the upcoming Squeeze will not     Maybe use dummy packages  or rename the packages so that KDE     could   remain installed  and not be forced to upgrade to Kde    That ship has sailed and it isn t coming back   KDE     is considered dead   Why some motivated person has not forked it yet has escaped me   If I had the time  resources  and ability  it would be worthwhile to me to see the KDE     codebase live on   If nothing else  the Lenny source tarballs would be a starting point for a new branch   I d expect some pushback from the KDE devs so it s likely the fork could not call itself KDE   Some will say that KDE     can go no further which was also said of XMMS which spawned Beep Media Player which spawned Audacious which is alive and well  last I checked   As I see it  KDE  has been given    years to match KDE     and they ve been unable to do so thus the time has come for someone to seriously consider reviving the KDE     codebase     I really feel sorry that KDE   series is no more being developed  and   when the day cames that I no longer will be able to use KDE    I will   switch to Apple or even Windows  but NEVER to kde  or Gnome     and I feel many users out there think like me      Well  don t go throwing the baby out with the bathwater as we say over here   I felt the same way but even though it is quirky  XFCE works fairly well as does GNOME in Linux Mint     Still  either pales in comparison to the KDE     as does KDE  but at the end of the day  the  DE is really not why I use a Linux distribution in the first place   So jumping to a proprietary OS is not an option     Nate       Thank you  keep the good work  Debian is one of the best   Agreed   No matter the distro I choose  they are all Debian based     Nate           The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds   The pessimist fears this is true    Ham radio  Linux  bikes  and more          To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
