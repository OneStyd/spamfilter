Medical notesURL    Date  Wed     Sep               GMT  Mixed news from yesterday s heart checkup    First  I went seven minutes on the treadmill  That was pretty good  My heart  was racing like it hadn t since I was in college  They also did an extensive  ultrasound on my carotid arteries     they re in the neck and supply my head  with blood  More good news there  They re clear  free of plaque  healthy  not  diseased     So it appears I just have coronary artery disease  not general  artery disease  That s good because there would be a risk of stroke if they  were sick  and not a whole lot they can do about it  as they can with the  heart     Now there was some not good news  A small part of my heart isn t working very  well  There are a few possible reasons for that  some fixable  some not  I  asked the doctor  does this mean I m going to die sooner  and he said no  Does  it mean I have to restrict what I do  he said no  So what does it mean  Really  not much  other than I should watch  as before  for recurring symptoms  the  ones that brought me into the hospital in June  If they come back  we ll do an  angiogram  and maybe an angioplasty  but the likelihood of another bypass  because of this is small  That s quite a relief  I don t like the idea of part  of my heart not working  but what can you do about it
