How to flush cache of certain disk Hi   On my netbook I m using automatic USB sticks mount through udev rules  and I already used to running  sync  command before unplugging stick  so no data will be lost  But if I have few sticks inserted and some information copying on one of them  if I run  sync  I have to wait while copying ends  because   a  sync command drops cache on disk  but copying process fill it again  sync will work until all the caches are dropped to disks b  I can t unplug stick when it stops to flash because I can t be sure that there are no more parts of cache needed to be flushed on that disk   So here is my question   how can I run sync for only one device   With best regards  Alexander Batischev       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
