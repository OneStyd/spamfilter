Re  Shutdown problem    cron job related    At certain times  seems Friday noontime  I am unable to shutdown the    system  Instead of the usual scripts to killing all processes  unmounting    everything and will now halt  goodby  I get          process running pstree  or something like that      shutdown aborted         At this point  the system  or at least any console or UI  is dead          What it this      Just see which process is running pstree     ps  eaf   grep pstree    You could find the parent pid of pstree  second column     Look at the parent of pstree  and the process started this one    If you go back that way  finally you will reach init  but before that you   could find which system process started these processes  I ll have to try it when I know the thing is running     As I recall  pstree is not part of basic installation    It was put to do some scripting  regarding found  in   perl python    My first bet would be to remove offensive cron line and   shutdown normally  Than to do filesystem checks  Next    to set cron to use pstree as a regular user  I think that   shutdown was done in some parts  aka closed network  What   has to wait  hangs the system    Otherwise  there is a chance that some housekeeping pro    cesses are started at noon every day  You could always   look at  etc directory and find them  Some unices have   it in  etc periodic daily  It starts with    bin sh    Another clue may be in  var log  as a result of newsyslog conf   I have no  etc periodic and no logs for pstree  I manually ran it  x   variant  and this is what I got  init   Xprt        akonadi control   akonadi ical re                             akonadi kabc re                              akonadi kcal re                               akonadi maildir                           akonadi maildis                          akonadi nepomuk    akonadi nepomu                           akonadi vcard r                          akonadiserver   mysqld        mysqld                                                 akonadiserver                                akonadi contro          apmd        atd        avahi daemon   avahi daemon        boinc        clamd       clamd          console kit dae        console kit da          cron        cupsd        das watchdog    das watchdog            dbus daemon            dbus launch         ddclient        dirmngr        dovecot      dovecot auth                   imap                     imap login                      pop  login         exim         fail ban server       fail ban serve          fetchmail           getty         gpm        hald   hald runner   hald addon inpu                             hald addon stor                hald         in tftpd        inetd        jackdbus        kaccess        kded     kded          kdeinit    kio file                   kio http cache                    kio imap                    klauncher                   ksmserver   kwin                                ksmserver                    python   python   python                   qjackctl    qjackctl         kdm   Xorg              kdm   startkde   kwrapper                                   ssh agent         kget        kglobalaccel        klipper        klogd        kmail    kmail         kmix        knemo        knotify         korgac    korgac         krunner    krunner         kxkb    kxkb         nepomukserver        plasma desktop   ksysguardd                             plasma desktop          portmap        postmaster   postmaster                     postmaster   postmaster        preload        proftpd        rpc mountd        rpc statd        smartd        spamd      spamd         sshd        svscanboot   readproctitle                     svscan        syslogd        tinyproxy       tinyproxy         udevd      udevd         xfs        xfstt        yakuake   bash   pstree x                     yakuake  Press return to close  Which would basically reflect what init ran and what kde  is doing when I did  it  Why would this be stuck at the end        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
