Re  Is acroread blind  or ps pdf dangerous Merciadri Luca wrote    Hi      When compiling any  tex document using the route latex    dvips      ps pdf  I get a PDF  Normal  but the problem is that if I the PDF is   already opened  e g  because I was reading the version of the document   before having modified and compiled it  when the compilation and the   whole process ends  the opened PDF is blank  i e  the current page   becomes white  and every page I go at is white  If I then re open the   document  I find the new version of my PDF      I would like to know how this process actually works  For me  it looks   like the ps pdf tool creates the PDF from scratch  and overwrites the   old PDF  But why am I receiving no warning message from acroread    Anyway  acroread seems not to be locking the file  or  if so  ps pdf   forces the writing      Thanks           Posting is so slow that I have already obtained the answer through comp text tex  So please do not take the OP into account         Merciadri Luca See   I use PGP  If there is an incompatibility problem with your mail client  please contact me            BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Using GnuPG with Mozilla      iEYEARECAAYFAkvsWygACgkQM LLzLt MhypgQCeN tU AlThqadgXK tw    z  qHEAnRBGe JoO     Q iwtKEA JtSDM   qvr      END PGP SIGNATURE
