Alternative to dhcp I edited  etc resolv conf to add a nameserver  edited  etc dhcp  dhclient conf  to do the same and added the dns to wicd   However  I keep getting the same  old dns from the router  i e   resolv conf keeps changing to the router s      ip   The router does not allow editing dns   I think this is due to using  dhcp   Is there an alternative which wouldn t cause a default to the router s  dns   Any pointers appreciated        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
