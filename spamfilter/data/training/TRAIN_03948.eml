Re   Battery is now fully charged   why do I receive this after  having unplugged the cable On Tue     Apr                      Merciadri Luca wrote     I receive the message  Battery is now fully charged  on my Asus EEE       HE under Debian Lenny   w  kernel             but only once I have   unplugged the cable  For example  the PC might be on AC power for      hours  and say nothing  If I then unplug the cable  it tells me that the   battery is  now  fully charged  Is it normal  Does someone else   experience this   It looks not so normal to me   But looking at Debian wiki for EEE systems it seems to be a known issue  with power management          Power management  On some models  the battery info is not very precise  jumps from     to        no rate information  etc    Apparently  this is normal  It appears  that the userspace battery utilities expect the battery to report mAh   but in fact it reports percentage  This is either a bug in the battery  firmware or a bug in the BIOS  it is known to be fixed with newer BIOS  versions and kernels                   THT   Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
