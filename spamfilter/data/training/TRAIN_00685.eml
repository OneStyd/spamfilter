 OT  Re  Jobs  Thoughts on JavaOn    Apr       at          wrote     Java  is  allowed on OSX   The situation between Flash and Java isn t even comparable   Java is open and useful  Flash is neither   Java still shares the the lowest common denominator cross platform   weakness strength  depending on perspective   which Apple may not want   to promote on the iPhone  because  let s face it  there are so many   patents on the iPhone that lots of that stuff can t be done in a   cross platform way  because other platforms won t be allowed to have the   same functionality  So cross platform code on the iPhone iPod iPad just doesn t make sense    The market is big enough that if their product sell on these devices    the developers can afford to make a first class citizen native app   rather than being lazy and trying to write the same things for   deployment everywhere   Nothing stops anyone from using a portable code engine  e g  C code or   Java compiled to C  and then put a native Cocoa Touch GUI on it   Flash from the get go was designed to captivate a part of the internet   and make it privately owned  just like Silverlight and a slew of other   efforts  too  Flash and Frames are the bane of the web  Can t properly   search  bookmark  print  copy paste  etc  any of these  May they die a   quick  painful death  they caused enough suffering for users and web   developers alike   Having a several dozen web pages open sucks the life out of the fastest   machines  because of all the flash  That I only could suspect until        put plug ins in subprocesses  The relative CPU load between all of   Safari vs  the Flash plug in speaks volumes   As much as I have to criticize about the closed nature censorship of the   AppStore ecosystem  I m THRILLED that Apple isn t bending  I hope Apple   can give the blow of death to Flash  which has been more than an   annoyance for many years  I can t wait until that s a chapter in   computing HISTORY  Bravo Jobs Co      I also support his statement about Adobe being lazy  No version of any   Macromedia Adobe Suite has ever run properly on any machine that has a   case sensitvive root file system  If software is properly written  it   shouldn t even notice a difference  and the only parties which have to   be aware of the difference are users that copy files in a mixed file   system environment  or writers of backup file management software  where     files on one file system might map to one file on another    Only sloppy coding where paths are not  define ed in one place but more   or less accurately copy paste ed all over the code base causes issues   with resource and path name mismatches when the software is installed on   a case sensitive file system  For a decade and several product cycles   Adobe didn t fix that  even though there were many bug reports about the   matter and even though Apple emphasized several times on various   occasions at WWDC that developers shouldn t make any assumptions on the   nature of the file system that the system is installed   Adobe didn t  want to  get it  They just wanted to continue milking   their old pre OS  code base for as long as possible  I wish Apple would   use some of their war chest to produce true competitors to Adobe s crap   that are reasonably priced  Adobe charges up the wazoo  and didn t care   to be a good platform citizen  and were it not for the    bit   transition  they d still ship old  buggy Carbon based code  Barf  I m   glad Jobs finally said it and broke with corporate politeness                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
