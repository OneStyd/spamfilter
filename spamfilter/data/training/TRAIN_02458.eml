Re  KDE menu wierdnessHeyho   On Tuesday    May               B  Alexander wrote      KDE Menu chaos     Anyone got a fix for it   Have you tried creating a new account and looking if it s there as well      The menu is basically system wide  but users may customize it  and I    absolutely don t understand how system wide and local menu are merged    If it s not system wide  removing the right files from your    kde     loca  l    and or    config directories should probably cure the proble    If you    didn t do much customizing you can obviously nuke your whole configuration      but in my case  that would lose quite a few hours configuration work  not t  o    speak of stuff like address book calendar data etc        cheers   D  vbi    D     I have opinions of my own   strong opinions   but I don t always agree with them             George W  Bush       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux  Comment  get my key from    iKcEABECAGcFAkvfwzBgGmh dHA Ly mb J eXR by jaC sZWdhbC ncGcvZW h aWwuMjAwMjA MjI dmVyc lvbj xLjUmbWQ c VtPTVkZmY NjhkMTE NDMyNzYw NzFiMjVlYjcwMDZkYTNlAAoJECqqZti   l SewAni yGMxmJ RF ZsSakC Ptcr y ujAJ zxncIYuAozeb b  cnLZLK kSkA    ffDN      END PGP SIGNATURE
