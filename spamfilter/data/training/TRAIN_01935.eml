Re  Kde             BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE      Hash  SHA   On Thursday    May       Mike Bird was heard to say    Debian is the sole remaining major   distro that cared enough for its users to ship KDE       When Lenny was released  KDE  was just plain broken  Since then  it  has matured such that other distributions which have released with  it   I do not believe the decision to stay with KDE  in Lenny was anything  other than the simple pragmatic fact that Lenny was being released at  that time     I guess this discussion is about trying to figure   out what KDE end users can do when Debian pulls the plug on us   As much as I prefer KDE   I agree that there is nothing else the  Debian developers can do  since to take up KDE  would require  effectively duplicating the entire KDE development team   The dropping of KDE  is a simple fact of life because it is no longer  maintained upstream  I hope the pain will be worth it in the long  run   What I do not appreciate is that the attitude has been not  we have to  do this   but  we re doing it  must suck to be you    Curt          Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end  for they do so with the approval of their consciences       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux   iQEVAwUBS Nb S Y  yItIgBAQLhGQf Xf HbACgc BXPDJv YrsJ pOo b w GJ ZPvBoJX Zlmr  zeCPhPdzLbRMYKfFMsbxHRfSF  x B PVqXegErFVdbKcVqH   lxRczYaXDbcYHcGdS Ntmw ZbSxRA xnnGeW feqPOAZI  KTU THQ KoCz fepi a y H SSgxUWXMwLEQ ij IvKKG aJnW   J  vcesXuEH xYf knkzxpQuc fzU  UYsJBQvrrHxO bE DeSNkdtUxjtwtSkXRex JUyEs  y IKRXmoPs WhXrYZTWo voTPSGs XpzgCxY I snVfFwA rtk  V xenuggFd Yh oGhjJl  Q     pV       END PGP SIGNATURE            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
