Re        weirdnessOK  I have since verified that sometimes I lose focus and sometimes X   pops to the front even when another application is runing  For example  I m using powerpoint  and then   gee  all my xterms  Hello  xterms  But Powerpoint still has  focus  in the sense that my keypresses go to powerpoint  which is hidden behind my xterms   But here s the thing  this all started with        This bug is not present in the Snow Leopard standard install  So perhaps there  is  something XQuartz app can do about it     Adam  On Sun    Apr       Jeremy Huddleston wrote     You guys might want to CC yourself to this ticket              The issue can t really be fixed by XQuartz app itself   If this is an   annoyance  I suggest you file a bug report with Apple       and indicate that it is likely a duplicate of                Thanks    Jeremy      On Apr          at        Adam D  I  Kramer wrote        The problem you describe  Doug  is a problem I have had before  but not    since upgrading to Snow Leopard         Only minorly relatedly  I would say that  loss of focus  is the single most    annoying thing that occurs in my use of OSX broadly speaking  Whether it s a    dialog box or a new window or anything  if I didn t click on it or somehow    intentionally direct myself to it  I really don t want to be typing in there    instead of where I chose to be         Is there any software anyone has heard of that can turn off the ability of    any program to steal focus           Adam        On Sun    Apr       Doug Carter wrote               For what it s worth  I ve seen this  and a related problem  since            I ve always suspected that it s a conflict between a OS window     manager event and the X server  The related problem is sometimes a     currently in use xterm will lose focus for     seconds  Sometimes the     focus returns  other times I need to click in the xterm to get the     focus back           I ve always assumed these problems were at a deeper event level  and     because they are so random and impossible to reproduce  I ve just lived     with them  Like the ticket referenced below  I d say it s a good bet that     there is some other process that is messing with focus           Doug          On Sun  Apr          at         AM        Jeremy Huddleston wrote       I have no idea what might be causing this  and I can t think of any change       between       and       that would have this type of effect             Please do try to narrow it down   I wonder if it is related to                      Jeremy                  On Apr

Xquartz app will       come forward  For example  if this window is the only one  above  firefox        in       the background  for some reason and in a manner I cannot yet predict or       cause  all of the other windows will come forward as if I had clicked the       XQuartz icon in the dock               The windows  order is not being rearranged   this window stays on       top   I m not losing any keystrokes   It s annoying when I m typing here        and       reading a webpage               This was not an issue under Apple s X   for       It only happens       once every few hours  so I don t know if it happened during the short        period       of time during which I used rc  or rc                I ll certainly write back if I have any way to reproduce it  but for       the mean time  Any idea what might be causing this                 Adam                                                             Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored        X
