Re  Minor feature request  How easy would it be to code a menu item that marks as read all messages    before the current message   I often have problems reading heavy traffic    mailing lists in exmh because I want to read only a subset of a lists    messages  but I lose track of where I was in the particular folder         This could also be coded more generally in the new sequences code as a way to    remove all messages before current from a particular sequence   Easy   First  you ll have to excuse me as I m still using            so  this may not play well with recent changes    I did look at        too   And  I just did this off the top of my head  I wanted to see if it      still worked   so this is somewhat untested   Adding a menu entry is trivial  add this to your    exmh exmh defaults    Fops more m uentrylist  ketchup  Fops more m l ketchup   Catch up all b  cur  Fops more m c ketchup    My Mark CurSeen  Then you just need to provide the source for My Mark CurSeen and  arrange for Exmh to include it  put it in your    tk exmh directory in your user tcl  or in pick patch if you enable the  source hook  under Prefs  Hacking Support   It s going to look something like this   proc My Mark CurSeen          global exmh pick msg     Exmh Status  Clearing unseen up to cur     red     Mh SetCur  exmh folder   msg id      set pick ids      get message ids for  pick   cur          busy PickMarkSeen     Exmh Status ok blue     that s based upon the guts of Pick MarkSeen   You need to fill in the code for the     get     section  I ran out of time   John       It just works   tm        it     my head                                                    Exmh workers mailing list
