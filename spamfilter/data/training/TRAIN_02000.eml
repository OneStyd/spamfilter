Overview does  such as insider trades and financial trends  along with many other tidbits of information   NOTE  You must use Excel      or higher for the spreadsheet to operate correctly        Flexible Renamer v          k  W x  k XP FREE        Rename your files  I work with a lot of files throughout the day  and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless copies and shortcuts

Buttons lets you add the new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program s title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize Maximize Close buttons   This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows  While writing this review  I am using the  Stay On Top  command for Notepad  and during this time I have already received five instant messages  Why is this important  Normally these messages would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work    but with Actual Title Buttons  I can keep typing without missing those  important  instant messages  The only difference is that they aren t an annoyance now  The  Minimize To Tray  feature is great  too  because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing

I hate it even more when the program doesn t leave a log file to help me track down the problem  Some would say I am out of luck  but as long as the program uses Windows Installer  then I am on Cloud Nine  Why am I so happy  Because for any program that uses Windows Installer  I can turn on logging through the Registry  Navigate to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE   Software   Policies   Microsoft   Windows   Installer  Add a new String value  double click it  and enter the following Value data   voicewarmup   sans quotes   These letters can be entered in any order  v   Verbose output  o   Out  of disk space messages  i   Status messages  c   Initial UI parameters  e   All error messages  w   Non fatal warnings  a   Start up of actions  r   Action specific records  m   Out of  memory or fatal exit information  u   User requests  p   Terminal properties  If you add a plus  the existing file will be appended  If you add an exclamation mark  each line is flushed  Now  when something fails  I just have to check in the  Temp  directory and look for my log files  They ll vary in name  but will always start with  Msi  and end with the  LOG extension  As always  make sure to backup your registry
