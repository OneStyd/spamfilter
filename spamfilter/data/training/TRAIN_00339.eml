Re  Increasing number of conflictsOn Mon  Apr          at              B  Alexander wrote    I ve got an issue with a sid box that I have been maintaining for a while    E This   is my workstation  and I have noticed a growing number of broken packages    unmet dependencies and conflicts  I have been using safe upgrade for mont  hs   now  hoping that it would work itself out over time  However  this hasn t   happened  So what can I do to fix the problems without losing functionali  ty    Below is the result of aptitude full upgrade  forgive the cut and paste    As a sid user you are certainly aware of the differences between  safe upgrade  and  full upgrade  and I would be interested in the actions proposed by aptitude if you run a full update   I assume that this will allow aptitude to take actions which are more to your liking as you obviously don t like the ones proposed by aptitude when you run safe upgrade   Thanks for testing a development branch of Debian         Wolodja                   Wolodja Wentland                                        R CAF  EFC                   C B CD FF    BA    EA    B   B F  D   CAF   EFC       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iQIcBAEBCAAGBQJLzFp AAoJEIt fTDK U   ScP  m  dUOHmazxUPu Pv XXPL AXaGdJq zB iKatYK MmPFjAOmCn  teUxhUFiK XCHkmuOux mNe BEq qEPdKS oyIkEsdIZzh hTogOV W PqwqlWvRYlXx iiny  v  SCTgRAf kMBeRdCaT  Ax o QVGs zraWjc VaCfeaiigOkLsT uovJan sze osY TD URom ltyItvjMqLFf eI Bv jYDGAkPVf AF lsmgnlbYN mdKfUXSUSB lXp ww V g S VyzgXGShr o Y txOShzVFoFjUjwlxZxAnY txKb IeIDy u yPcgj roN ThHL  cAoMD tcP   z FYtX F Morc   g efImv  dA U dId GqCjWQvHKmyQ LplBEgCRZyVxBkJdV X ZcW OXhaGP Pam j Slyaa PofHA OSLRZQmyURNuqGkHu TKGM v vreJ FoD VamYcF No C fd LvYsqHQE   ea X BEiH   mmYkXL zHh XvqS  ZFKohUBUE KiZB   jO G Eh      gwqVUKWetOrwlzbJh ewiCAlk YnOtg xElhsengnSPt  MZWMmtsqvMDG  FuNltvqTaafkk jaaEeGYupU p TtCkovR TKc cqgQHuhPPg t C JN xvtEE irZFLpr  Xf w      END PGP SIGNATURE
