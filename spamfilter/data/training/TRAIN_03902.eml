Re       Update   crashing IDEA on pasting codeHi Guy                  The problem is caused by an NPE in the Swing   accessibility code when a JList subclass overrides the   getAccessibleContext   method and returns null  You can hit this crash   when using a tool that scans the IntelliJ UI using the Accessibility   API  We believe we have a fix for it  but as a workaround if you avoid   using tools that use Accessibility with IntelliJ  you can avoid the   crash   Thanks  Bino George  Java Runtime Engineer  Apple Inc     On May           at      AM  Guy Gascoigne Piggford wrote     Is there any update on this   I use Idea all day and every day so this   is a complete blocker to me upgrading         Is there any way for anyone other than the bug reporter to see the   status of a specific bug   Apple s bug parade doesn t appear to be as   open as say Sun s was         Guy        On Wed  May          at       PM  Phillip Ashworth     wrote     Thanks   I ve filed bug report ID             I ve discovered that the crash occurs when the pasted code includes   class name that are not already imported in the current document  IDEA   then pops up a window to select the class to import and crashes   instantly and every time     I ve not got any screen reader or accessibility software running but   I do have LaunchBar and TextExpander   not sure if these count      Phill                On    mag       at        Bino George wrote            Hi Phillip                         Can you please file a bug at     with the crash log attached to it   I tried   to reproduce this myself but could not  can you also include the exact   steps to reproduce  Please mention any screen readers or other   Accessibility tools you may have running             Thanks      Bino George      Java Runtime Engineer      Apple Inc             On May           at      PM  Phillip Ashworth wrote              Since updating to      Update   Intellij IDEA crashes when I paste   code from one class into another in the main editor   see exception   below       JetBrains support say this is an Apple problem  anything I can do   about it or is it a bug in this java version               Regards      Phill                                                   Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
