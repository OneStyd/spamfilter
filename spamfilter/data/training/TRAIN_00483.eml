Re  Electric car an Edsel   Ouch     hooooo      Cheers  RAH      begin forwarded text   Status  RO Date  Thu     Sep                     From  Same Guy Subject  Re  Electric car an Edsel    To   R  A  Hettinga      Bob   This guy s an idiot   I design loads for systems with the    kV capacitors   One of those has     of such capacitors and stores only    megajoules  which means    kilojoules each   They weigh     kg   You need high energy per unit mass  and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that   It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles   You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor  which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to     volts  the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage   Ignore him   He s a waste of my time                                 From   R  A  Hettinga      Subject  Re  Electric car an Edsel      Date  Wed    Sep                       To  Some people           begin forwarded text   Status  RO Date  Wed    Sep                      PDT  From   Adam L  Beberg    To   R  A  Hettinga    cc    Subject  Re  Electric car an Edsel     On Wed    Sep       R  A  Hettinga wrote     Maxwell     makes and sells high energy density capacitors    called ultracapacitors   They deliver them in an air cooled  voltage   regulated module that will charge to    V and hold     kilojoules    roughly   the energy in   teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut    and weighs      kilograms   If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic   energy  there s enough to get the capacitor module up to about     mph    in   a vacuum   Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like     C  V     you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible to fully exploit that V      So yea  a   V system will only be useful for accelerating insects  not cars  That must be why   kV is standard not      the joke of putting    into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW   Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors  as very few real world applications run for less then    seconds like the car we were talking about originally  Even    seconds is pushing the  capactior is the wrong choice  limits  Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one  it s got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve   But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy     version  not the     mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice    For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor  you want to take advantage of whole atoms  not just electrons  Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell  However  you will use both capacitors for the braking accel  and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design     Adam L   Duncan  Beberg              end forwarded text                         R  A  Hettinga   The Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation   The Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation       Farquhar Street  Boston  MA       USA      however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity   predicting the end of the world  has not been found agreeable to experience      Edward Gibbon   Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
