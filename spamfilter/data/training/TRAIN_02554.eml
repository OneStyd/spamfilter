Re  Anolther sequence related traceback    Date         Fri     Aug                         From         Chris Garrigues       Message ID          Interesting   I don t think this was my bug      It appears that Msg Change was asked to change to message       Something like that is quite possible  but perviously typing nonsense in didn t cause tracebacks  and now it does  and the traceback came from the sequence code     Perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status line complaining about my lousy typing    That s probably what it should keep on doing  the  red  part isn t important obviously     kre                                                    Exmh workers mailing list
