Don t do the brown WiFi  the brown WiFi is BADURL    Date  Not supplied  Rob  Pringles Can  Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O Reilly OS X con  has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network  here    every    or    seconds  you start getting  connection refused  messages  from your browser and other net utilities  Rob  Pringles Can  Flickenger wrote  it up    It turns out that running the great network spy app Etherpeg     or other   promiscuous  network sniffers  and the built in firewall in OS X at the same  time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your  segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a  rejected  message    So today  Rob  and everyone else who knows about this  is going to run around  and tell people running Etherpeg to  turn off the firewall   and vice versa    Ah  fickle networking  you are such a stern mistress  Link    Discuss       Thanks  Rob
