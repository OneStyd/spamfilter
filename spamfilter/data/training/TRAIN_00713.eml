John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust based      targetted advertisURL    Date  Not supplied  John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust based  targetted advertising     based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet  gold rush    Nobody believes advertisements    any more  There s a lot of evidence that  advertising just doesn t work  no matter how targetted  so if you have a  product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side  where  consumers  defenses are lowered  Product placements are one example of this    There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons  here  When advertising first  rose to prominence  advertisements  did  work  We hadn t built up our  immunities yet  As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium  to lie  we learned not to trust advertisements  But we still trust editorial   And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead  of advertising to promote their message  nobody will believe it either
