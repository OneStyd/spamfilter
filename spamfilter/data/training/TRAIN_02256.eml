Anolther sequence related tracebackJust got this     I was just reading mail  but in a very dark room  where the keyboard is illuminated mostly by the light from the  laptop  screen    I think I put my fingers on the wrong keys   I mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh    This is from today s cvs  the fixes for the problems I mentioned yesterday are included    I eventually managed to contact the cvs server   expected integer but got        while executing  incr m       procedure  MhSeqExpand  line         invoked from within  MhSeqExpand  folder  msgids       procedure  MhSeq  line        invoked from within  MhSeq  folder  seq  how  oldmsgids  msgids       procedure  Mh SequenceUpdate  line         invoked from within       Mh SequenceUpdate  folder replace  seq  msgids       procedure  Seq Set  line        invoked from within               Seq Set  folder cur  msgid       procedure  Mh SetCur  line              invoked from within                       Mh SetCur  exmh folder   msgid       procedure  MsgChange  line                      invoked from within                               MsgChange   noshow      invoked from within                                   time  list MsgChange  msgid  show       procedure  Msg Change  line        invoked from within                                       Msg Change  select sel  noshow       procedure  SelectTypein  line                                   invoked from within  SelectTypein  mid right top msg         command bound to event   kre  ps  I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal  and the  colours from the ftoc  stuff all deleted  and it is looking just about as good as the old unseen window used to look    I still have some work to do to make it a little nicer  listboxes seem to have some strange habits  and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized  at the minute I m just embedding stuff in the code  much quicker for prototyping   Once its done  I ll send a patch for someone to look over                                                     Exmh workers mailing list
