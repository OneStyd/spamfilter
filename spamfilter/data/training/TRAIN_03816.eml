Re  KDE       in unstableHello   On ketvirtadienis    Gegu C  BE C                   Boyd Stephen Smith Jr    wrote       But whether      upstream software meets users  needs is out of Debian scope         There s a lot to consider  since Debian needs upstream s help in addressi  ng   bugs throughout the lifetime of stable  and that s easier to achieve with   the latest release   But then again  stable needs to be usable on release   day   Release early  release often  is great for development  it is not so   great for stability  both in  lack of bugs  and  lack of change    meanings   Sometimes the most recent release from upstream is not best for   Debian stable   You missed my point completely  What is subjectively unusable for you  is    perfectly usable for others and the other way round  Debian is not your    personal distro  it strives to keep balance  And balance is towards     sid  e    you like it or not due to many factors  When Squeeze is released  KDE     m  ay    be in    or later patch release upstream so the point about the latest and      greatest here is completely out of place   Now if at particular time upstream software does not meet your personal nee  ds     you go and look for alternatives  You talk like kdepim     was flawless  Bu  t    it wasn t  There is no place for  software does not do X  remove it from    stable  discussions here        Just find      another software solution which does  develop it by yourself  pay      somebody to develop it for you or ask kindly and wait till somebody      else is motivated enough to do it         I will  but I see no reason not to air my grievances   Insisting that others do something  revert to kdepim      based solely on y  our    personal grievances does not help productive communication       YOU run a dozen of DB servers         I m not the only person that does   Most users have a SQLite datatbase th  ey   don t even know about   People that develop or test web applications   generally have to deal with a DB as well   In small shops  the test   database often lives on the developers work system        YOU don t want another one  YOU don t trust     MySQL         I m not the only one with these concerns   I ve never said that you re the only one  I find myself in the odd position      that I mostly share opinion with you about excessive  explosion  of DB serv  er    instances on the desktop but I still can t help myself to argue  You starte  d    this off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to your needs       YOU say KDE     is inappropriate for stable         That is my opinion           Nothing objective and             YOU assume that your truth is an ultimate one         Not really   I made objective statement about KMail based on observable   facts  I also voiced an opinion that I based on that statement   What facts  That kdepim kmail needs akonadi  That s hardly news  Akonadi    integration is not stable enough  There is still time to improve it  That s      what Ana s blog was about        If YOU have so      many problems with particular piece of software  look for better optio  ns      or read the first part of this mail again         I have problems with a very narrow selection of selection of the software    Specifically  I don t want to need MySQL installed in order to use KMail   effectively in Debian stable   It is not like every mail client on the market suddenly needs MySQL  Actual  ly     kmail is probably unique in this area     There are a number of solutions to this   Newer Akonadi should run on non    MySQL data stores   Older KMail doesn t talk to Akonadi   Patches could be   applied to either   Stable could include software from multiple KDE   releases  as has been done before   What I tried to say to you all this time  if Akonadi renders Kmail unusable   to    you  switch the client  Akonadi by itself is not a bug  it is not going awa  y     Take it or switch to something else  simple as that     D     Modestas Vainius         BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvjODsACgkQHO JRnPq hT lQCgwuZWzOd nnx ooluJ s uwnf XNkAoNNOsKyv IHxLM gyOMebkbsqtDy   CFv      END PGP SIGNATURE
