Re   ILUG  SUSE   disks   thread changed slightly Quoting Paul Linehan         I m confused  I thought it was GPL ed and that the money you paid SuSE   was for your    day support or whatever    Yes  you re confused   A Linux distribution   any  Linux distribution  contains lots and lots of separate codebases   Some are under the GNU GPL   Many are not   Are you clear on this point  now   This is my second try   One suspects that you actually understand perfectly  but just don t like it   You re further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to get covered software for free   It does not   It provides that  if  you ve lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version  you have rights to also receive the matching source code     I don t particularly need support  so I m not really interested in   purchasing a set of disks with   billion apps which I ll never use   Then  if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set s contents  the only way you can do that without copyright violation  and  without having to pay the purchase price is to get someone to  give   not  lend  or duplicate   you his copy     Yes  thanks for your input  Anyway  I ve a friend with     pro  so   I ll just ask him   Ask him  what    If you re asking him to  lend  or duplicate his CDs  then you ll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally   Don t like SuSE s product licensing   Write your own distribution   You can even grab most of what you need  from SuSE    All you have to do is  heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces   What  you think that s too much work   Then  try a different distribution   Clue    Not  one packaged in a retail boxed set   Even RH     retail boxed sets include non freely redistributable applications on the Star office     CD and the Productivity Applications CD  among others    The core   CD set of the basic RH distribution  on the other hand  contains only software that may be freely redistributed  whether  open source or not        Hi  I m a  signature virus  Copy me into your    signature  to help me spread  Hi p I m a  signature spread virus  Copy into your    signature to help me Hilp I m  sign turepread virus  into your    signature  help me  Copy Help I m traped in your   signature help me           Joe Slater      Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
