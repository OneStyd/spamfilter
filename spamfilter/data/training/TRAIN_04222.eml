Re  Moving a drive to another computerOn Wed  May          at         PM        Vince Vielhaber wrote      A friend was running windows and the viruses got the best of it  She   sent me the drive so I could get her pics and documents off of it and   put       on it and send it back  she s a few states away       What problems  and solutions  should I be expecting when she installs   the drive in her computer   I m assuming the network setup will be one   problem      My background is mainly in FreeBSD   If a drive is set up as being    dev ad  and the other machine sees it as  dev ad  it won t complete   the boot  it ll complain with a cannot mount root error   Will that be   an issue with Debian    Besides the fstab and udev issues that others posted  you should be pretty good   I recommend setting up a button on her desktop that sets up an ssh tunnel so you can get in and add fix stuff    Rob       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
