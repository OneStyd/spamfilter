Re  gnome panel tray icons transparancyOn Mon             at              Camale  n wrote    On Mon     May                      Steven wrote         On Sun             at              Camale  n wrote                   gnome panel  some application icons lost transparency in notification      area                  Anyway  check if the affected applications make use of  EggTrayIcon             I found a patch for Rhytmbox dating February          which replaces     EggTrayIcon with GtkStatusIcon  looking at the source I d say this     change is already present in Squeeze  So I d say the bug you mention     doesn t affect Rhythmbox  or the bug is assigned to the wrong package       AKAIK  Rhythmbox plugins got splitted from main package and now fall into     rhythmbox plugins   So if the upstream version with the patch on     GtkStatusIcon  was included into Debian packages  the  diff  should be    visible and available there     Correct  the folder structure clearly shows the plugins folder  it is my understanding that both packages come from the sources I mentioned in my previous e mail  In that plugins folder  for the notification icon  GtkStatusIcon is used  the diff doesn t mention either EggTrayIcon or GtkStatusIcon  so I would assume that patch is included   Still leaves me with this issue  unfortunatly   Regards  Steven       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
