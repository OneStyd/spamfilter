Re  KDE       in unstableI don t get what you re trying to accomplish   On            Boyd Stephen Smith Jr  wrote    In      kmail depends on mysql server in order to send mail   kmail      Akonadi     mysql server    So you don t like the dependency to Akonadi  Too bad  As can be read on many places  Akonadi is  there to stay  And as you mentioned in another post  the dependency to Akonadi has been in place for  a while now  Korganizer and KAddressBook since       So there s no way in hell you re going to have   upstream  support for an Akonadi less PIM   Or don t you like the Akonadi dependency to mysql server  Well  it s not the full mysqld package  anymore  but the dependency is to mysql server core        see           SQLite has been found inappropriate since it lacks proper transaction support  PostgreSQL is apparently capable of providing the proper features and Tobias Koenig has made Akonadi  working with PostgreSQL since the end of last year    and postgresql html   That patch was committed to trunk at that time  but apparently didn t make  into SC          So if you want to use PostgreSQL  your best bet would be to port base that patch on         Just block the KDEPIM     apps from migrating to testing   The KDEPIM        programs already work with the KDEBASE     libraries       Heck  just stop kmail from migrating   Korganizer and KAddressBook have    required Akonadi since     or earlier   Yeah right  let s get a combination of     and      and       into stable  that surely must be  preferable  And good luck getting any upstream support for bugs resulting from that   As Ana indicated the freeze won t wait for SC      so better make the best out of      If you want the freeze to wait for      better try to convince the release team  Good luck    Diederik       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
