Re  Multiple Graphics cards and HDMI  How to Victor Padro wrote    On Thu  Apr          at      PM  KS   wrote     Hi all        I have setup a system with Gigabyte MA    GPT UD H motherboard and use a    Nvidia GeForce     GTS PCI E video card  It also has an onboard ATI    Radeon HD      graphics chipset  The PCI E card is being used at the    moment for the monitor  nvidia driver   I was thinking of using the HDMI    port onboard  to play movies directly on the TV rather than using a    DVD RW  current method         I did configure the onboard chipset to be detected after the PCI E card    as D SUB HDMI output in the BIOS  This is on a Debian Unstable box        The question is  would it be possible to use two graphics cards from    different manufacturers        I also noticed that the onboard chipset does not come up with lspci       AFAIK  when you use a PCI e VGA onboard video is disable  and your   lspci states that        Yes  that seems to what was happening  I have remove the PCI E card and the machine was able to detect the onboard VGA chipset  using module radeonhd    At the moment  when I boot  I get     x    resolution on both of them  monitor and TV  with both showing the same image  I have tried to create an xorg conf using   but it is not being applied  both outputs have     x    resolution even though I have specified the preferred resolution in xorg con   Does anyone see obvious mistakes in the file or if I have missed something   Thanks  KS  PS  I just realized that I could have used a DVD HDMI adapter for my Nvidia     GTS card too  However  its fan is really noisy                    Section  Module           Load     bitmap           Load     dbe           Load     ddc           Load    dri           Load     extmod           Load     freetype           Load     int             Load     record           Load    type            Load     vbe  EndSection  Section  InputDevice          Identifier       Generic Keyboard          Driver           kbd          Option           XkbRules        xorg          Option           XkbModel        pc             Option           XkbLayout       us  EndSection  Section  InputDevice          Identifier       Configured Mouse          Driver           mouse          Option           CorePointer          Option           Device                   dev input mice          Option           Protocol                ImPS            Option           Buttons                            Option           ZAxisMapping                         Option           ButtonMapping                          EndSection  Section  Device          Identifier       ATI Technologies Inc Radeon HD      Graphics          Driver           radeonhd          BusID                             Option           AccelMethod     EXA          Option           Monitor VGA     Lenovo Monitor          Option           Monitor HDMI     External TV          Option           Audio   on          Option           HDMI   all  EndSection  Section  Monitor          Identifier       Lenovo Monitor          Modeline             x                                                               HSync  Vsync         Option           PreferredMode       x            EndSection  Section  Monitor          Identifier       External TV          DisplaySize                      Modeline             x                                                         HSync  Vsync         Option           PreferredMode       x                   Option           RightOf   Lenovo Monitor  EndSection  Section  Screen          Identifier       Big Screen          Device           ATI Technologies Inc Radeon HD      Graphics          DefaultDepth               SubSection       Display                  Depth                               Virtual Screen size add widths   max height of monitor  for right left config                 Virtual                           EndSubSection EndSection  Section  ServerLayout          Identifier       Default Layout          Screen           Big Screen          InputDevice      Generic Keyboard          InputDevice      Configured Mouse  EndSection       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
