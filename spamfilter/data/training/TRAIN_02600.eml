Re  Are bad developer libraries the problem with M  software  I don t know how one can expect better and more secure code from the community when this being a security list some post like this shows clearly no knowledge of C   On Fri  Nov          at         PM        Ali Saifullah Khan wrote    Here is a test done on the return of sizes by sizeof   using pointers        include        int main void       char  testbuff                                 Read it like this  new array with      elements of type pointer to char  As a pointer occupies the natural word size     bits or   bits   no wonder you get         sizeof char      numer of elements       int len   sizeof testbuff      cout    return           using   int len   sizeof  char  testbuff     sizeof returns the size of types  You can use it with vars  and then the normal form is sizeof var  not sizeof var    but if you re changing the type with the var with a cast  of course you ll get the size of that new type   Regards  Luciano Rocha      Consciousness  that annoying time between naps
