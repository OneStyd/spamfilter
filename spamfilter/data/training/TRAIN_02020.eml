Re  Retrieve hardware and modules info  On Mon    Apr               Lubos Rendek wrote    thanks guys for this   Now what is the best way to link modules to a   specific hardware  for example my lsmod shows that I use  ecb  module    For someone like me this name does not say much  Is there a way to   find which module belongs to which piece of hardware      sbin modinfo ecb filename         lib modules          amd   kernel crypto ecb ko description     ECB block cipher algorithm license         GPL depends            vermagic                 amd   SMP mod unload modversions      I use the full path because modinfo is in  sbin  which is usually not    in the user s  PATH    But if you are curious only about the hardware related modules lspci    will tell what modules are used by the respective hardware  You will    need to run it as root with the  vvv parameters   Regards  Andrei       Offtopic discussions among Debian users and developers          BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iQEcBAEBCAAGBQJLuQ FAAoJEHNWs jeoi pSh H  SKiBi   OcTywuc kn cNJ  sV  R CZcO eje B lmbhaJD lVrlvOvKvptDt  NgDhn  hekXQjewqvV Zjh  O eWf A Ftysyrkq EdS bFmOm Ha yMpQf IutpCuZEdGehw hZ Nq rsX ViYg mcBuBMTdNYKhlA  kCw GRtqvztncskersY wVhutlCSlHv Bokckyu neEQJKm   bdmMBwGOVP ffKFHzZ H L Vexk  j   NJ  B UgT eGYBJRUSoysColFN W r Z qkdXiUMC m gpDcKqnzOM VXKi  FqVo Q RtbX ghTXqB J QUXavyMT d w   xOuM      END PGP SIGNATURE
