 Spambayes  test sets  Barry A  Warsaw  gives answers and asks questions   Here s the code that produced the header tokens       x n          for x in msg keys            x n x    x n get x             for x in x n items            yield  header  s  d    x   Some responses                        header X Mailman Version                         header List Id                         header X BeenThere        These three are definitely MM artifacts  although the second one    could  be inserted by other list management software  it s described   in an RFC    Since all the ham came from Mailman  and only    spam had it  it s quite safe to assume then that I should ignore these for now                        header Newsgroups                         header Xref                         header Path        These aren t MM artifacts  but are byproducts of gating a message off   of an nntp feed   Some of the other NNTP   headers are similar  but I   won t point them out below   I should ignore these too then                        header List Unsubscribe                         header List Subscribe                         header List Post                         header List Help                         header List Archive        RFC recommended generic listserve headers that MM injects   Ditto     So why do you get two entries for this one                         header Received                         header Received     Read the code     The first line counts msgs that had   instances of a  Received  header  and the second counts msgs that had   instances   I expect this is a good clue   The more indirect the mail path  the more of those thingies we ll see  and if you re posting from a spam trailer park in Tasmania you may well need to travel thru more machines           Note that header names are case insensitive  so this one s no   different than  MIME Version     Similarly other headers in your list   Ignoring case here may or may not help  that s for experiment to decide  It s plausible that case is significant  if  e g   a particular spam mailing package generates unusual case  or a particular clueless spammer misconfigures his package                        header Precedence        Could be Mailman  or not   This header is supposed to tell other   automated software that this message was automated   E g  a replybot   should ignore any message with a Precedence   bulk junk list    Rule of thumb   if Mailman inserts a thing  I should ignore it   Or  better  I should stop trying to out think the flaws in the test data and get better test data instead                        header                                        header       Heh   I sucked out all the wordinfo keys that began with  header     The last line there  was probably due to unrelated instances of the string  header   in message bodies   Harder to guess about the first line           Some headers of course are totally unreliable as to their origin   I m   thinking stuff like MIME Version  Content Type  To  From  etc  etc    Everyone sticks those in   The brilliance of Anthony s  just count them  scheme is that it requires no thought  so can t be fooled     Header lines that are evenly distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators  prob near       so do no harm
