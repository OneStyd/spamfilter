Google  Not in ChinaIn a slightly old news story  it turns out the Chinese government has banned all access to the Google and AltaVista search engines            The reason appears to be the Google cache feature  I can only imagine the Internet Archive will soon follow  if it isn t already blocked   Seems that governments do have some power over the Web  after all     Jim
