Re  Portable RPMsOn Fri             at        Torsten Bronger wrote     If I create an RPM according to one of the how to s with having   Red Hat in mind  how big are my chances that it will also work   for the SuSE distribution  or others    I don t know how many   base on the RPM system        Or what must I pay attention to when creating an RPM that should   work with the big distributions   One practice I ve adopted is to list Requires  only when they re absolutely necessary   This will help because some packages are named differently between distributions  eg  SDL   libSDL   and the dependencies are automatically handled by RPM by depending on shared library names   This doesn t apply to BuildRequires  though   Use macros for directory names where available  eg    libdir      bindir      datadir  etc   I d like to suggest using as many RPM macros for command names as possible too  but unfortunately I don t know of a definitive reference about them     I have a small RedHat     RPM apt repository at
