Re   IIU  IE nameserver problemsJames Raftery wrote       I don t know what role ns  plays in relation to the IE zone  It s   certainly not involved in the regular resolution process  It may   be involved in zone distribution as you suggest  IIRC  and I often   don t  on Friday ns  had a serial that none of the IE nameservers   shared  Unfortunately I don t have a record of that     From indexing CNO  ns  appears to be IEDR s CNO nameserver for its CNO domains  iedr com and others         This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR s decision to     outsource the technical admininstration of  ie to a company that     apparently does not even admin its own DNS  It is a nice story though       almost as good as the time that  ie disappeared for   hours in July                    and only you noticed        Messages on the IEDR FORUM list at the time don t support     your assertion    Yeah but I was right and I was there  The people who were saying that it did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress  It only came back after the server was rebooted properly  However improbable it seemed at the time  the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the  ie zonefile  As a result it  there was nothing in the file that the secondaries picked up  At the time  I thought that the file was on an NFS  But if it regenerated after reboot  and the NFS input was not there  it would have generated a blank zonefile   that makes some sense  History now but it has an alarming relevance         As an aside  shortly after my note on Friday uucp gw   pa dec com and   uucp gw   pa dec com stopped responding to DNS requests  So IE had   two dead nameservers  four stuck a week in the past and three   working correctly  Marvellous   Confirm that  The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from what I could see and it was going on for a while  even  after  the initial SOA problems    I am thinking of writing a simple  ie secondary state monitor for inclusion on WhoisIreland com as these guys seem to be technologically incapable of running their own DNSes  What kind of distorted logic hands the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS for its own domain  Whatever selection process IEDR used should be investigated by the relevant government department  especially as the company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not actually spot this loss of synch  The IEDR contract with the company should be reviewed in the light of this event  This kind of   week loss of synch should not happen with a national domain  Ireland as E hub   more like e jit central      Regards   jmcc                                                  John McCormac              Hack Watch News              Viewmount   Voice                      Waterford  BBS Fax                    Ireland                                                      BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK      Version       mQCNAzAYPNsAAAEEAPGTHaNyitUTNAwF BU mF PcbLQXdeuHf xT UOL  Od z  ZOCAx Ka LJBjuQYw hlqvTV kceLlrP HPqmk YPOw fQWlpTJof ZMCxEVd Qz TRet vS kiRQRYvKOaxoJhqIzUr g ovBnIdpKeo KKULz XKuxCgZsuLKkVAAUX tCJKb huIE jQ  ybWFjIDxqbWNjQGhhY t YXRjaC jb   tBJqbWNjQGhhY t  YXRjaC jb     sTfy      END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK                                                      IIU mailing list
