Re   SAtalk  O T  Habeus    Why Justin Mason                                  Well  my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that   a spam hits         Any higher does us no good  as it means an FP is   a lot harder to recover from  using compensation rules   Agreed   But I have always thought that the value   was not the best value   It should have been     I understand that initially only spammy scores were included   But I believe the algorithm should be purely symmetrical and non spammy negative values should also have been balancing out the spammy positive values  like they do in SA today  Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative would be non spam    And I guess exactly zero is grey      Today s choice of   just adds an offset   Which I think cause people to assume things work differently than they do   Bob       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux   iD DBQE bky  pRcO E ULYRAjI AJwMoi s IUg XpVAwCqpBC gcd cQCfepOm COS  YufMiFLSHhCZ KkLxU   YwM       END PGP SIGNATURE
