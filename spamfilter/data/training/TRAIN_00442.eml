Re  Al Qaeda s fantasy ideology  Policy Review no      There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous  population  but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is  sound   It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I m a little  more suspicious of very high upward revisions   Right  there was definitely a relatively high density in Mexico  and much less elsewhere   Population estimates vary wildly and about all your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark figures   While Central America may have had    or    million  vast areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very sparsely e g   the plains Indians in what is now the U S  may have been   million or so   There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from    something million to circa   or    million in the   th century  certainly  in part due to infectious diseases new and old  and other factors  and was probably in decline before contact   Others claim it declined from    ish million to   or   million and somehow deduce     mortality from imported diseases  and have a pretty clear agenda which makes me  for one  take their claims with a large grain of salt   About all that is certain is that anyone alive in      was dead in       in the Americas or elsewhere   R
