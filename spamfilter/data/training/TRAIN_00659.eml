Re  New Sequences Window    Date         Thu     Aug                         From         Chris Garrigues       Message ID          hmmm  I assume you re going to report this to the nmh folks   Yes  I will  sometime  after I look at the nmh sources and see what they have managed to break  and why   But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that exist  don t we    The patch to have exmh do the right thing  whether this bug exists  or not  is trivial  so I d suggest including it   Patch follows      I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list before  not that it should make any difference to nmh  or MH     But since I stopped doing that  the variable  msgs  isn t really needed any more  rather than assigning  pick msgs  to msgs  and then using  msgs the code could just use  pick msgs  where  msgs is now used    This is just a frill though  so I didn t change that     kre      pick tcl Fri Aug                       usr local lib exmh     pick tcl Sat Aug                                          proc Pick It           global pick exmh      set cmd  list exec pick   exmh folder   list       set cmd  list exec pick   exmh folder        set inpane        set hadpane        for  set pane      pane     pick panes    incr pane                                    set msgs  pick msgs       foreach s  pick sequence      lappend msgs  sequence  s   lappend cmd  sequence  s             lappend cmd  list        Exmh Debug Pick It  cmd  msgs      busy PickInner  cmd  msgs                                                     Exmh workers mailing list
