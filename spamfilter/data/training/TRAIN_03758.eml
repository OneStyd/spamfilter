Re  Timezones for Kontact seriously broken in LennyOn Sun             at              Camale C  B n wrote    On Sat     Apr                      John A  Sullivan III wrote           Hello  all   We have some clients eager to migrate from     Exchange Outlook Windows to Debian Lenny   Zimbra is working well on th  e     back end but is lacking as an Outlook replacement   great web interface     but still lacking some essential features   Evolution does not support     Address Books from Zimbra so that leaves us with Kontact   Kontact is     great except it seems seriously broken in several regards specifically     Korganizer   The KDE response is to upgrade to KDE                   The fact is that upstream KDE developers have stopped the development of      kde     x branch  so no more improvements are added to the existing      programs  I think only critical bugs are still watched and fixed                Since we are on     Lenny  we are on KDE     and we d like to keep it that way until KDE      matures a bit more   How are Lenny users handling the crippling bugs                 I was a KDE     x user for long time             but switched to GNOME as        soon as the first KDE     came to scene  it was not intended for end    users but  we had  to deal with it and the result was many people      searched another alternatives  me included          But now  KDE SC     has nothing to do with that times  Last time I tested        I found it stable enough for daily use  So the advice of updating to KDE         if you still want to use KDE  is now valid                I did not see anything in backports   Here s what we are seeing             Timezones  Any appointments synchronized with Korganizer from Zimbra ar  e     interpreted as UTC   Thus  all appointments are offset by our offset     from UTC   This is the bug which is rendering it unusable and is     apparently well known   I can t believe this is broken in a production     system             Malformed URIs  Calendar requests via IMAP are requesting     myserver mycompany com    Calender instead of     myserver mycompany com     Calender   We can work around this by using     webdav instead             This is crippling us on a potentially huge Lenny deployment   Any know     fixes  Thanks   John             Dunno how to manage this in Debian     but there is a dedicated list C    B       that may provide you more accurate help about this          C  B      Ah  this is so deeply frustrating  KDE     sounds great but it is nowhere to be found in Debian but in experimental and it sounds like it is nowhere near ready for production          is truly and completely  unusably broken for calendaring other than in a standalone world   It looks like Evolution has introduced webdav support for contacts in      and we can grab      from testing   That sounds better than experimental so maybe we need to abandon KMail  sigh  and think about Evolution instead   Thanks  all   John       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
