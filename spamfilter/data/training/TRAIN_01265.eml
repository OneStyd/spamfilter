change   to      udev was required  see also the list history for several threads on th  at      topic             I am in exactly the same situation                 Does hal know that there is a touchpad           A  lshal  u   hal find by capability   capability input touchpad             The output of    should tell you the associated linux device file  in      A  my case this is  dev input event   The next step is to find the      A  devpath           A  udevadm info   query  Dpath   name  D dev input event             I get   devices platform i     serio  input input  event   from          A  Now one can test what udev does when the device is added  maybe that      A  command will give you a clue  or you can make the output available   so      A  that we can compare           A  udevadm test  devices platform i     serio  input input  event             I followed your advice  here s the output of that command        It s quite long  and I have to say that I have very little   understanding of anything it says     It looks OK to me  your custom rules file is read by udev  line     and the corresponding variables are set  lines              I do know that  etc udev rules d    xorg synaptics rules is the file   that I created when HAL stopped working  and it was working up until   two days ago  more or less    I now tried to activate the extra options in the fdi file that comes with xserver xorg input synaptics and that gave me right edge scrolling and the other stuff  Thus it seems that the fdi directives are working right now on my Sid system   As I wrote earlier  I have not used these features in a long while  therefore I do not know if the fdi files worked all the time or if this functionality was only recently restored    I suggest that you try the same approach and then we can compare our results  In other words      Shut down X and remove your custom udev rules for the time being     then restart udev   invoke rc d udev restart      Uncomment the extra rules in     usr share hal fdi policy   thirdparty    x   synaptics fdi  You have    to close the comment in the     to    the end of this line  also insert a new line with        just before    the line starting with  For other possible options  check       Restart dbus  which will also restart hal      invoke rc d debus restart      Verify that hal is paying attention to the newly uncommented options     the output of          lshal  u   hal find by capability   capability input touchpad      should include      input x   driver   D  synaptics    string     input x   options CircularScrolling   D  true    string     input x   options HorizTwoFingerScroll   D  true    string     input x   options MaxTapMove   D          string     input x   options SHMConfig   D  true    string     input x   options VertEdgeScroll   D  true    string     input x   options VertTwoFingerScroll   D  true    string      Restart X  then find the synaptics part in  var log Xorg   log  It    should contain lines like these       II  config hal  Adding input device SynPS   Synaptics TouchPad     II  LoadModule   synaptics      II  Loading  usr lib xorg modules input  synaptics drv so

HorizTwoFingerScroll   true          Option  CircularScrolling   true      Check if VertEdgeScroll and the other stuff works  if it does then    you can try to add your other options to the fdi file and remove the    ones that you do not like  Once you are done with the tests you can    restore   thirdparty    x   synaptics fdi to its original state and    put your rules into a separate fdi files so that they will not be    overwritten at the next upgrade of xserver xorg input synaptics         Regards                         Florian           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject
