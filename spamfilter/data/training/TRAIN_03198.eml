Re  Is acroread blind  or ps pdf dangerous Sjoerd Hardeman wrote    Op                 Merciadri Luca schreef            Sven Joachim wrote     Thanks for this answer  There are  many  reasons not to use pdfLaTeX     They do not enter in the scope of this mailing list  but I am pretty    sure you will find them directly on the Internet  For example  pdfLaTe  X    encourages one to use directly JPG  etc   for the inclusion in the    document  which is pretty bad  There are also many incompatibilities    with different packages              Or png or pdf which basically is eps or even real eps via the epstopdf   package             Sorry  pdflatex offers more choice  That s not a bad thing         I do not agree  sorry  PDFLaTeX generally write bigger PDFs  simply because there is no compression  consider for example   Moreover  I think that psTricks does not work with PDFLaTeX  you need to use PDFTrick  s    I also vaguely remember about many situations where  if I had had to use PDFLaTeX  I would not have been able to produce the same document  because I would have had to change many packages which were incompatible     You might ask on comp text tex  this is a better place for this  because this is my point of view  and it is not shared by the whole community         Merciadri Luca See   I use PGP  If there is an incompatibility problem with your mail client  please contact me    Instruction ends in the schoolroom  but education ends only with life   F  W  Robertson         BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Using GnuPG with Mozilla      iEYEARECAAYFAkvtNmUACgkQM LLzLt MhyJ QCfU ACR Xxtaxol mqjLRUkPp  vwMAoJ s tUQtkCPz  N Ji HYqy wwJ   ITe      END PGP SIGNATURE
