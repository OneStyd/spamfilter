 ILUG  gargnome   sawfish   I decided to try out GarGnome  to see what gnome  looks like  It s pretty  I ll give it that    However  there seemed to be loads of bugs   sawfish threw wobblers all over the place  so I tryed out metacity   which doesn t have a GUI configurator  and arsed if I m going back to the fvwm days when you had to set settings by hand  without an idea what the values looked like    So  I went back to       and now sawfish can t start applets  yes  I did change the LD LIBRARY PATH back  and the panel can t make new workspaces    Any ideas what could have happened   Would sawfish     silently change the config files   break them   Kate       Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
