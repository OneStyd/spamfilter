Re  Migrate OS to smaller   UTF   Q drive  F  On Sun     Apr                      Ron Johnson   wrote    On                   thib wrote     Ron Johnson wrote      Yes   wire  is slang for network cables  but SATA cables are actual      wires too and orders of magnitude slower than CPU RAM transfer         This is true  but isn t relevant to what you suggested     Think about it some more                    Oh yes         We ll never talk about this again  I promise          thib        PS  I ll tell you something embarrassing about me if you find a SATA     controller that can inflate           You re absolutely correct   This time        I ve used dd to push a copy of a working system onto larger drives in the past  So my misuse of the term  migrate  is me actually doing a copy of the working system to a new  larger device and then zap the original   I d hoped there was a block by block way to do it so I didn t have to set up the partitions   filesystems ahead of time but I suppose that part won t be too painful   The system is relatively idle during these types of surgeries because I boot from a live CD so the data on disk isn t churning   Thanks to all who responded  it gave me a lot to consider for this type of project  Like doing proper diffs afterwards to make sure everything landed on the new device properly        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
