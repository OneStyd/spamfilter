 ILUG  RE  Newbie QuestionRegarding  Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN  USB modem   LASAT Speed Basic    however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux  but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser  without installed drivers   Thanks for your replies     However i still cant get it to detect the External USB modem  I also have an internal   k fax modem  but i cannot get that detected either   maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported    Im not going to buy a new modem   I think   is more than enough for   PC     It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more difficult  but whatever it is iv just about had enough   Any last gasp ideas would be welcome  Many Thanks  Mark        Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
