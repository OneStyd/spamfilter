 IIU  spyware calling home Hello all I m looking for advice  My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying to access IP               without my consent  It has got to the stage where normal web browsing is almost impossible  I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being called  I contacted that company on    July  when the problem first arose and asked for a remedy but  surprise  got no reply  A helpful person on the ie comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal  I ran this and haven t had a problem again until today  The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db   I run adaware with current ref files every day now   Any suggestions  please   for removing whatever the f    is causing this from my pc  Brian                                                   IIU mailing list
