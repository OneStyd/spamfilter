Re   ILUG  LCD monitors and linuxOn Fri  Aug          at         PM       or so it is rumoured hereabouts   Niall O Broin thought    On Fri  Aug          at         PM        Conor Daly wrote         My     CRT monitor having drowned in a flood    cm squared of burned      circuit board URGH     I m thinking of a     LCD as a replacement        What with me going to the continent and all next week  I might wait and      buy one there  for a reasonable price  Dave Neary   Any good sources          Conor   it s a rather large continent   people might need to know where you   are going to suggest sources  And if you re buying abroad  make sure you get   to test it   many places won t have facilities for you to do that   Um yeah  I suppose that d be useful info     Western France  La Rochelle area   Test as in test with Linux or just turn on and see that it works       Question is  CAn I just plug in  any  lcd monitor and expect it to work        Are there special incantations needed for XFree   to work   Needless to     say  it ll be a bit difficult to bring it back to the shop once I m home      in Dublin and find it doesn t work       Any monitor should just work   they all have VGA connectors and any half   decent brand will be know about by XFree setup programs in modern   distributions  However  if you have the budget  insurance paying for the   dead monitor  perhaps     and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a  Bathroom upstairs  Computer desk downstairs  got dripped into  started clicking rapidly and smoking before it was noticed and unplugged       flood    getting a monitor with a DVI input is best  Of course  you ll need   a DVI out video card then  too  DVI provides a much better picture than VGA  I guess that requires something more in the way of budget then     Given that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for   boxen  via a   way vga KVM switch   I d be looking at investing in   DVI cards along with another KVM to suit while a VGA version  should  just plug into place    Conor     Conor Daly    Domestic Sysadmin                           Faenor cod ie       pm  up    days            users   load average                   Hobbiton cod ie       pm  up    days            user   load average                        Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
