Re  Re  Kde        On   May             Lisi   wrote    On Thursday    May               you wrote        You still have gnustep  xfce  lxde  no using any or simply never       upgrade            I have looked at all those  in addition to KDE   and Gnome   None appeals      to me   Each has something that I strongly dislike or does not have      something that I like and use a lot        Please tell me what KDE     is missing  or what it has that you    dislike  I can help address those issues      I doubt it  because I think that the problem is the basic philosophy   They   have sacrificed funtionality in favour of glitz      E g       You cannot turn off all those horrible  and to me actually physically   painful  I have problems with my eyes   special effects   before  being   subjected to them    All that horrible wobbly  wavy  shimmery  spinning   transparent glitz    That boils down to  it s on by default   Just go turn them off  And the defaults do not have wobbly windows  wavy effects  or anything shimmering  Nothing spins either  but the Alt tab dialogue does slide  There is plenty of transparency  though  and I hate that too  So I turn it off   My mother suffers from what she calls  vertigo  and the effects do not upset her  Nor do they upset the autistics that I volunteer with  They are merely an annoyance to those annoyed by them  nothing wild         ctrl tab does not move to the next window   Do you mean between tabs  Fixed           alt F  is cumbersome and unhelpful    In KDE     x I can type e g  k and be   presented with a list of all the applications that I have previously used   beginning with k    It works that way in KDE   as well  so long as you have opened them from Krunner in the past  That is how I open all my applications         Alt F  does not bring up the menu   It s Alt F  for the Kmenu  Has been since KDE   I think         Kcontrol no longer exists   It s called System Settings  and with the Tree menu it s very similar  It is being reworked for KDE      so if you have any suggestions then now is the time to make them     etc etc     Tell me more         I am  however  very sad that KDE      which I regard as the pinnacle of      DE s  is being laid to rest        Then help me shape it s successor  What is not suitable about KDE        Why would I rather have a Toyota hatchback  especially a hybrid one  than a   two seater sports car     You evaded the question  I cannot help when you evade the question        Dotan Cohen            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
