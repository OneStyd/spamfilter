GNOME crashes when  xsession file is present If I create an empty    length   xsession or an  xsession file containing one line  say  echo hello  world  I get this error when I try to log into GNOME   Your session lasted less than    seconds  If you have not logged out yourself this could mean there is some installation problem or that you may be out of disk space  Try logging in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix the problem   There aren t any errors in  xsession errors when I try to log in with the   length  xsession file  In case of the  xsession file with echo hello  world  I see just  hello  world  in the  xsession errors file   Why does this happen        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
