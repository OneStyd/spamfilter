Re  Lite SMTP server daemon Replying to my own message    On Mon     Apr                     Celejar   wrote          Hm  I had thought that at least some of the small  relaying MTAs   accepted connections on port      On closer perusal  it looks like they   don t       One option would be to build your own version of one of the big ones    with all unnecessary functionality excluded   I don t know what the   resulting binary size would be   I was sufficiently intrigued by the  apparent  absence of a simple MTA that does the above  so I decided to write my own  Tmta   It actually works  and is documented  although it s still pretty much in the proof of concept stage      One important thing that it does  not   yet   do is fork  it s currently implemented as a basic  single threaded daemon  so it can only accept one connection at a time   It shouldn t be too difficult  famous last words      to convert into a multi threaded model  although I have no experience with that sort of thing   It is still small  though   under    lines of actual Perl code  although it does  of course  require the basic Perl installation and about a half dozen other modules   If anyone has any feedback  or suggestions for improvement  I d love to hear them   Celejar     foffl sourceforge net   Feeds OFFLine  an offline RSS Atom aggregator mailmin sourceforge net   remote access via secure  OpenPGP  email ssuds sourceforge net   A Simple Sudoku Solver and Generator       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
