Re  KDE       in unstableHello   On penktadienis    Gegu C  BE C                   Boyd Stephen Smith Jr  wr  ote    I should have some time to pitch in and help before and after the freeze   date  What can I do to make sure KMail doesn t need Akonadi when Squeeze   is released   I ve been told that back porting the Akonadi PostgreSQL   patches is unlikely to help         I m not averse to helping  but I don t have lots of time    a few evenings   a week at most   I m not  unable  to help  but I m not too familiar with   Debian packging of the KDE SC   x code case    I can read write all the   computer languages involved  though   Supporting and testing unreleased or beta software is the biggest problem    If    you want your pet issue fixed  you have to get akonadi from trunk  build it       test whole Debian s KDE     x  extensively  with it including third party    akonadi plugins like googledata one  Finally severe regressions should be    fixed  For packaging  README Debian needs to be written on how to switch DB      backends since there won t be GUI for it  And when this is done  that akona  di    could be considered for stable   In other words  you have to do part of upstream release management work    without knowing the code well  You can be sure that upstream won t be pleas  ed    with Debian releasing unreleased version of akonadi  But maybe you can    convince them otherwise to release earlier to accommodate Debian needs  The  re    is lots of work to be done   Initial akonadi trunk packaging is at      I have been using it with SQLite      for over a month now  Yet I don t use akonadi features extensively  not eve  n    addressbook or korganizer  so I can t tell much about quality of the code    But    I can tell you that if you don t step up  this plan probably won t make it        trunk   branches akonadi trunk        You started this off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to yo  ur      needs          Please  is not a demand last time I checked         I think that KMail requiring MySQL to function in Debian stable is a   problem  I request that the Qt KDE packaging team take steps to ensure   that Debian stable users are not stranded with that situation for the   lifetime of stable   It might be a problem for some people  short on RAM on their machines   not   a    problem for others  Generally  you need to stop talking and generalizing wh  at    you don t know  like keep claiming that releasing with different versions    wasn t considered despite obvious proof on the contrary          There are a number of solutions to this   Newer Akonadi should run on       non  MySQL data stores   Older KMail doesn t talk to Akonadi   Patches       could be applied to either   Stable could include software from       multiple KDE releases  as has been done before             What I tried to say to you all this time  if Akonadi renders Kmail     unusable             to you  switch the client  Akonadi by itself is not a bug  it is not      going away  Take it or switch to something else  simple as that         I m not saying to get rid of Akonadi tied KMail   I m certainly not saying    Akonadi by itself is a bug    I d be perfectly happy with   Akonadi PostgreSQL making it into stable  in fact I d be excited to play   with Akonadi   PostgreSQL SQLite is a FEATURE  it is not a bug which has to be fixed no    matter what  If you want it in  stop ranting and start working on it  Give      fewer lessons how Debian works and actually do something useful towards you  r    goal  Especially since the lack of technical knowledge or background should      not be the problem for you     D     Modestas Vainius         BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvj  UACgkQHO JRnPq hQeLwCeNtUsYU Of   JC QAXDqFimX  bcAoObLzQSLj x lBK  Hld sUPDeLC    t       END PGP SIGNATURE
