RE   OT  spam tagging  From  Nuno Magalh C  A es  mailto      Sent  Wednesday  May               PM        Hi         An idea that just came to me    With all the  small amounts of    granted   spam that has been coming through the list  would there be a   feasible way for uses to reply to spam messages to the list with some   sort of tag  so that those would be tagged as spam asap  I e  one   receives spam  one replies to it  to the list  with a string like    SPAM    or whatever  and after a few hits of those the   mailer or whatever would tag that message as spam         It would probably take some load of the maintainers  back and give the   spamed a warm comfy feeling            ducks for cover     What good would that do   Everyone on the list will have already   received the spam        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
