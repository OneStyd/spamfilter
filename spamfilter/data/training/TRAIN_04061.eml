Re  How to manage multiple Internet connections On Sat     May                      Merciadri Luca wrote      Bonding  seems to achieve what I wanted to do  Thanks   Sure  I don t think so       Bonding  is for ethernet devices  nothing to do with using your   router s bandwith   Ethernet bonding is like hard disk raid  it will  prevent for a  link  going down and you can use it to increasing  throughput but what you want to achieve is not done with that  as you  will be still facing the problem on how where to route packages   Also  bonding requires at least   ethernet adapters    A very good bonding tutorial      But you may need something like this   How To  Load Balancing   Failover With Dual  Multi WAN   ADSL   Cable  Connections on Linux    And I advance you is not an easy task   P  Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
