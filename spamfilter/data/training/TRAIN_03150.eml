Re           does not recognize PATA WD disk   This is not a kernel bug  but the way debian uses drivers   There are two different drivers in the kernel now  Old ide drivers and newer pata drivers   Old ide drivers are going to get deprecated  For some reason debian stock kernel is taking only ide drivers   I have seen this with both my desktop  ide amd  xx used  pata amd is not at all compiled  and laptop  both ide piix and pata ata pii modules are compiled  but ide piix used  Because of that my hard drive is shown as  dev hda instead of  dev sda with the debian stock kernel   What I did was to compile a custom kernel by including only the pata driver  s  Now with this custom kernel everything is fine and consistent              C  E  FE F  E  EF F   D  DC EB EB E  F       Hi to everybody      I  A just got a WD caviar blue  with the classic IDE interface and tried   to   connect it to my debian squeeze pc which already has a WD SATA device  wh  ere   the OS lives      The problem is that          does not recognize the disk and although I m   not an expert  I tend to think that it is a kernel bug  I booted with                and it sees the disk       A   A           hda  WDC WD
