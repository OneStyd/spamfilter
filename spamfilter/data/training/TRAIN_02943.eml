Re  More acroread printing problemsOn Wed             at              John A  Sullivan III wrote    Hello  all   With the appreciate help from this list  we finally learned   we needed to install Acrobat Reader version       from unstable into our   Lenny systems in order for Acrobat to see our CUPS printers   However we   are still having problems printing anything other than letter size jobs    It looks like acroread is creating an lpr command using the  o   PageRegion and setting that option incorrectly   For example  in one   case we saw  o PageSize   x    p PageRegion Letter which printed the     x   print job on letter sized paper   On a plotter we saw  o   PageSize   x    p PageRegion A  which resulted in the plotter rejecting   the job as an invalid page size   Bypassing the Acroread print command   by using a Custom printer and sending the job to KPrinter works so this   seems to be a clear bug in how Acrobat is reading the PPD file and   creating the print command       Has anyone else encountered this problem  Is there a workaround  If not    I suppose I ll need to figure out how one reports bugs for acroread to   Adobe   Thanks   John       Oops  typing a little too fast   That s appreciated help and the PageRegion is preceded by  o and not  p   John       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
