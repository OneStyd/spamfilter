Re  AUGD  Displaying iPad at a meeting  what doesn t workExcuse the  dumb  question  I have never gotten close to an iPad Yet   Could an iSight take the place of a camera for connection to the   projector    On Apr          at      PM  Terry White wrote     While a native connection is always best  we ve used an Epson Document   Camera  purchased off eBay  for iPhone iPod presentations in the past   and plan to do so next month for our iPad preso  For a NEW one I d look   at the Elmo brand    Our epson can go to the Projector AND S Video out simultaneously so   that we can capture the feed using an EyeTV device for our recordings    Again  quality is what it is  but it does work for us         See our meeting using this method here        Time Marker          into the movie        On Apr          at      PM  Dan Spiess wrote          We ve used a TV camera hooked up to our projector to shoot display an   iPhone  It s a bit clunky  I was hoping for a better solution with the   iPad                           Dan Spiess          On Apr          at      PM  David Ginsburg wrote             This is the most frustrating thing with Apple and iPhone   ipad   display hook for us who want to teach this  I d love to hear if anyone   has successfully displayed it on the screen                               On Apr          at       AM  Jason Davies     wrote                         On   Apr       at        Chris Hart wrote                            Our group has decided to start an iphone ipad SIG  so we will   also be        looking for a permanent solution that will allow us to put the   screens of        these devices up on a projector                 Yes  I m a bit dismayed about this as I was hoping to ditch My   laptop in the long run  We don t even have iPads in the UK yet                   which applications will actually work  Can I use it to do a PDF   presentation  I don t even have things like Keynote  no need for them   when you only produce PDF presentations   I realise it s not the lists   purpose  but if someone feels helpful                   I agree on  reply to  ideally going back to the list in this case    I have known lists where the opposite was preferable but this is not   one of them                                                        Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored        Augd mailing list                Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription                    Robert Poland   Fort Collins  CO                                                     Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Augd mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
