The future of  nv  driver  was  Linux compatible mainboards   another thought On Wed     Apr                      Ron Johnson wrote     On                   Camale  n wrote            nv  driver  only   D      Except that Nvidia deprecated this driver a few weeks ago               only for  newer   fermi  cards          Will they keep it current with X   Let me  copy paste  from the official announcemnet                For this reason  NVIDIA is dropping support  on new GPUs  for the xf   video nv driver   Details     NVIDIA will continue to support the existing functionality and existing level of acceleration in the nv driver for existing GPUs  on existing  and  within reason  future  X server versions     NVIDIA will not support the xf   video nv driver on Fermi or later GPUs     NVIDIA will not support DisplayPort  on any GPU  in the  xf   video nv driver        So I think the  nv  driver will keep the same  bugs features  that has  right now and will still get some security patches  but I m afraid that s  all we  linux users  can expect         Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
