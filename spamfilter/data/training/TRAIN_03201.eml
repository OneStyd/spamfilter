Re  apect ration change on wide monitorOn Mon     May                      Martin wrote            So after reading replays my conclusion is that none of LCD wide monitors   do not offer possibility to change aspect ratio by software  Same that   designers of monitor and protocol that its use to communicate with   computer did not thing about this feature  I hope that I am wrong   Well  for watching movies in your PC you can always use the media player  abilities to re scale the video into     aspect ratio      But if your vga card cannot provide higher resolutions to the monitor   then you are stuck  LCDs can only work well at their native resolution   So your first step should be to find the specs of your VGA card and check  what is the maximum resolution it can provide   Your display will be happy at     Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
