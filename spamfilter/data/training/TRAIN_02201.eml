Re  What to choose for Core i     bits On                  PM  Stefan Monnier wrote     The    bit vs    bit argument is multi faceted   It gets much deeper t  han    just addressing more than  GB of RAM       twice the transfer width on the bus        Nope  no difference on the bus    Most accesses will be   cache line sized anyway at that level   You re kidding  right  You can push twice the data  which means faster CPU to memory utilization for CPU intensive applications  Flash anyone        no memory split issues        For   a bigmem kernel on a  GB system  I can say that even for other systems      it s not necessarily relevant   It s very relevant  You must not have run into this issue much      kernel splits are the best you can do on a    bit system  but it comes at a performance cost  Splitting and performance are never an issue on    bit until you ve reache    EB of RAM        increased virtual address space        Right   Unlikely he ll ever notice it   Whether he will or won t isn t the issue  I m not discussing use cases  I m discussing the facts on why    bit is superior to    bit        more breathing room for mmap   d files        Again  unlikely he ll ever notice it  otherwise he wouldn t have asked     E  See above        deeper nested system calls with increased stability        I see no evidence of increased stability and have no idea what you want     to say with  deeper nested system calls    I ll give you an example  Use XFS on LVM  and export the mount over NFS  The nested system calls in this scenario will cause a kernel oops on any  K    bit kernel nearly every time  the default for Debian GNU Linux  Fedora  Ubuntu  openSUSE  etc   On a    bit kernel  because you have the ability to make deeper nested system calls  you have stability in your infrastructure  Something that couldn t be achieved with a    bit kernel          certain applications and operations will execute faster        Yup   And others will be slower since you ll have to move around more   data  up to twice as much if your data is made up mostly of pointers     which means that the apparent cache and RAM size will end up   being reduced   The same would be said for a    bit application implemented the same way  Poor software development is hardly an argument against choosing a CPU architecture      If you have the hardware  you should definitely be running a    bit    operating system  even if you don t have  GB  of RAM         If you have to ask  you probably won t notice any difference   either way   To each their own  I for one want to get my money out of my hardware  If you don t want a    bit system  then why did you pay for it           E O     O   O       O   O         O     E   O     O O   O   O     O O       O O O O     O       O O   O O     O O O        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux  Comment  Public Key at    Comment  Using GnuPG with Mozilla      iQEcBAEBCgAGBQJL  TTAAoJEM  Ebf BAiP p H  R  lO nYvpfTqxeT AalEa GQmB ClVwpMlIkmonDdVcuBrEqQ Z AnWHzVXPt yBliar  xXGj   pTAuMT LG  C UJ T lDKspcdAMB eEuwvsBopX oDHUTSOJk frLONkEQiGJSbAKp aDSP CA NxrKF dyxug xMI  TaodiCUSc tBPBKuwUvlDGK F StqeursiGvEGJdVz kZHE oE pufE iNicGa wn WuDnQa lRSnLYDqtJ gud frW JGxUWcq aoXiU aEGuEl JjhfgCqxzRaN eTMeaH mePDr FH  iBsfYGyFfdF KpK   BXaHbt  fLAHcSU   NVwG      END PGP SIGNATURE
