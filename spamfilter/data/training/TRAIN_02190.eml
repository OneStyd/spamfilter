Re  Where to find setup for env variable   a question On                  Paul Chany wrote    Hi       I have setup somewhere the JAVA HOME environment variable  but don t   know where      snip  When I am reading this thread there are already two search suggestions that are better than what I might have come up with  My post is to find out where the setting was actually done  I would have thought it could only be in  etc or  home     but wierd things can happen  Where is it  How long did the search command take to run  And some idea of the size of your working environment   If the cause for that particular location appears to be something that involved user volition  it could still be useful to know what mistakes can be made  Better than learning from ones mistakes is learning from others experience  TIA      Paul E Condon                    To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
