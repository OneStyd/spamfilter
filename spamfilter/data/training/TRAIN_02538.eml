Re  Java graphicsgeneration on Mac servers without graphics hardwareStuart Wier   wrote     It seems that Java on Mac OS X doesn t use X    or Xvfb  at all  Is it   attempting to interact with the quartz Cocoa Aqua window framework   Yes   The X server is completely secondary  and I don t think Apple Java interacts with it at all     It seems not particularly interested in whether or not an X server is   available or the DISPLAY variable is set or whether you ve tunneled X   through SSH   Right     Is there is a way to run Java graphics generation on the Mac        server without a graphics display   I need to know so I can move   forward in some other way   Rewriting the program is not an option     headless true  is not a help since the program needs to run just as   if it had graphics   If you are using AWT  you need to give your program access to the console   Apple uses a Mach involved security model of namespaces to control access to various things  you can find more information on it at   Worth reading   Several times   But the pertinent bit is   A process can only use the global window server service if its EUID is    it s running as root  or matches the UID of the console user  All other users are barred from using it     I don t see an update of this document for       either     How can I set up things so that graphics generation proceeds and makes   image files as if graphics hardware were available    The program is   designed to do this using X  either with X   with graphics hardware    or with Xvfb   You could try installing another Java that includes a client Xlib implementation  and go from there   Or  of course  run your program on Linux or FreeBSD or OpenSolaris instead                                                       Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored    Java dev mailing list            Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription           This email sent to                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
