 ILUG  Re  Problems with RAID  on cobalt raq On Mon  Aug          at         PM        John P  Looney mentioned     This is likely because to get it to boot  like the cobalt  I m actually   passing root  dev hda  to the kernel  not  dev md      Just to solve this   the reason I was booting the box with root  dev hda   not  dev md  was because  dev md  wasn t booting   it would barf with  can t find init     It turns out that this is because I was populating md  with tar  Which seems to have  issues  with crosslinked files   for instance  it was trying to make a hard link of glibc so to hda   and failing  It was only as I did it again with a friend present  that he spotted the errors  and queried them  We noticed that the hard linked files just didn t exist on the new rootfs    When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar  it worked fine  I was able to tell lilo to use root  dev md  and everything worked    Woohoo   Kate       Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
