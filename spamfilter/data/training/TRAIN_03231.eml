Re  pinentry window Hello   On ketvirtadienis    Balandis               Adrian von Bidder wrote    Heyho             and  sending the last mail  is it a Debian specific issue  or some   local feature of my KDE profile  or a KDE bug  recently      to      but   I m not sure exactly which updates triggered it   the pinentry window   always comes up behind the kmail windows when I sign email   Confused me a   bit at first     luckily it is still modal relative to the kmail window    so the kmail composer gets greyed out  indicating that the pinentry might   be somewhere            Mostly everything related to KDE is experimental or qt kde repository    pinentry qt  is           I believe this is new pinentry qt  to blame rather than KDE SC         D     Modestas Vainius         BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAku ouUACgkQHO JRnPq hRxqwCdH OEBLgnRLw  nyvw SxQnpS wRYAn TogeSYvFSuVrw P xSBdfS  Lb  Yt f      END PGP SIGNATURE
