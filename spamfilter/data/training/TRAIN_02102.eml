JAWT macosxDRAWINGSurfaceInfo gets the wrong componentI ve got a Java application that contains a  panel within a frame and I want to draw into the panel and the method works on Windows  with OS specific modification   However  when I execute the program on a Mac it would appear that NSView  view   dsi mac  cocoaViewRef  returns the parent window  which in this case is the frame   Is there anyway I can modify the code below to ensure that I always have the panel as my windows context rather the frame   David              Get the corresponding peer from the caller canvas         NSView  view   dsi mac  cocoaViewRef                     NSWindow  window    view window           NSGraphicsContext  ctxt    NSGraphicsContext graphicsContextWithWindow window           CGContextRef cg    ctxt graphicsPort                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
