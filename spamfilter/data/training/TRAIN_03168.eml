CO  and climate  was RE  Goodbye Global Warming On Mon             at        Jim Whitehead wrote       You have not explained why the increase in CO  concentrations is not   contributing to increasing global temperature    There are a number of reasons to think that CO  is not important to controlling global temperature and that much of the CO  increase may not be anthropogenic  Some recent research points worth mentioning   Recent high resolution studies of historical CO  concentrations and temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest correlation between the two  In a number of cases  CO  level increases are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the increase in temperature by a short time i e  increases in temperature preceded increases in CO  concentrations  The more studies that are done of the geological record  the more it seems that CO  concentrations are correlated with temperature increases  but are not significantly causative  There is a lot of evidence that CO  levels are regulated in a fairly stable fashion   I don t believe anyone really has an authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet   With respect to absolute CO  concentrations  it is also important to point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly regular cycle with a period of about         years   At previous cycle peaks  the concentrations were similar to what they are now   If this cycle has any validity  and we only have good data for     complete cyclical periods  but which look surprisingly regular in shape and time   then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now   As it happens  current CO  concentrations are within     of other previous cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data  In other words  we may be adding to the CO  levels  but it looks a lot like we would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical record   At the very least  there is nothing anomalous about current CO  concentrations   Also  CO  levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately affects temperature   Again  the interaction is not entirely predictable  but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative feedback systems mentioned above   Last  as greenhouse gases go  CO  isn t particularly potent  although it makes up for it in volume in some cases   Gases such as water and methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule basis   Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas  something that CO  only indirectly effects through its interaction with the biosphere   CO  was an easy mark for early environmentalism  but all the recent studies and data I ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver   I certainly don t think it is a healthy fixation if we re actually interested in understanding warming trends   Cheers    James Rogers
