Re  Re  Re  Help needed  error booting to btrfs filesystem  On Fri  Apr          at      PM  Eugen Dedu     wrote      On Fri  Apr          at       AM  Eugen Dedu       wrote          What is the filesystem of  boot          It should not be btrfs        Well   boot is on the same filesystem as    only one FS   so it is    btrfs   Does not grub  boot linux from btrfs   I have seen Web pages    saying that it boots         It is unlikely because  boot grub contains ext  mod  jfs mod    ntfs mod  ufs  mod  ufs  mod  xfs mod  zfs mod but not btrfs mod   Indeed  I see in sources that fs  does not contain btrfs c     So it seems that  boot must use another FS for the moment     Well  I will wait     Thank you very much for help      Eugen       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
