Re  New   button serial mouse not detected by LennyOn               AM  Chris Austin wrote    Hi      I have just bought a new   button mouse since   button emulation does not seem to work well in Lenny   I had a lot of trouble with unpredictable behaviour apparently due to contact bounce and getting unwanted context menus  some of whose entries were sometimes unintentionally activated  with bad effects   but unfortunately the new mouse is serial rather than PS        I have done dpkg reconfigure xserver xorg as root in a terminal before starting kdm  but there was no mention of a mouse  only keyboard options were mentioned   And the new mouse is completely non functional after doing kdm      I have also tried Xorg  configure  and the following message was given      Xorg detected your mouse at device  dev input mice   Please check your config if the mouse is still not operational  as by default Xorg tries to autodetect the protocol   Your xorg conf file is  root xorg conf new      The only mentions of the mouse in  root xorg conf new are in the first section      Section  ServerLayout            Identifier      X org Configured            Screen          Screen                 InputDevice     Mouse    CorePointer            InputDevice     Keyboard    CoreKeyboard    EndSection     and in a later section      Section  InputDevice            Identifier   Mouse             Driver       mouse            Option       Protocol   auto            Option       Device    dev input mice            Option       ZAxisMapping              EndSection     I ran X  config  root xorg conf new to test the new xorg conf  but the new mouse was still nonfunctional   It was plugged into Serial port    and I also tried going into the BIOS and altering Onboard Serial Port A from  f h COM  to Auto  but this didn t help either      Are serial mice supported in Lenny      Best regards    Chris Austin           I would take X out of the equation  and see if you can get it working in the console with gpm       Kent       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
