Re  lilo removal in squeeze  or   please test grub   Stephen Powell   writes     On Mon     May                      EDT   Ferenc Wagner wrote     Stephen Powell   writes      On Mon     May                      EDT   Ferenc Wagner wrote       Stephen Powell   writes        Both grub legacy and grub pc use sectors on the hard disk outside of       the master boot record                 You may want to try extlinux  it works much like LILO in this respect          Thanks for the tip   That may be an option   I looked at the documentation     online  and there does not appear to be an option equivalent to lilo s     vga option  though  which I use a lot  especially since svgatextmode     has already been pulled from squeeze         I m not sure what you re after  I haven t used LILO for ages   But    typing vmlinuz        vga  xf   at the pxelinux boot prompt gives me a      x   console   The other variants use the same code      Interesting   At one point  the kernel itself had de supported the   vga boot option  relying on the boot loader to set the video mode   before transferring control to the kernel   And now you re saying   it s back   Hmm   According to Documentation svga txt in the kernel   source tree         This small document describes the  Video Mode Selection  feature which      allows the use of various special video modes supported by the video BIOS       Due to usage of the BIOS  the selection is limited to boot time  before      the kernel decompression starts  and works only on   X   machines      Note the wording  before the kernel decompression starts    That to me   implies  done by the bootloader   because the bootloader decompresses   the kernel  if it is compressed  before transferring control to it    does it not   It does not  the kernel is sort of a self decompressing binary  However  the vga  parameter is indeed parsed by the bootloader and passed to the kernel by a special protocol   It s then used before the kernel parses its command line     I m going to have to try installing Squeeze using extlinux as the boot   loader    No doubt I ll have to change bootloaders after installation    as the Debian Installer won t offer that option    Yes  you ll have to back out of Grub installation  start a shell  chroot into  target  and install exlinux   Take care to have  boot on an ext  partition      Good luck  Feri        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
