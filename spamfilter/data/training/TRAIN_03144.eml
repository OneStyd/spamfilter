 zzzzteana  And deliver us from    Weevil pest warms to life in south west London  James Meek  science correspondent Tuesday October         The Guardian  They re chomping in Chelsea  Fulham and Pimlico  but despite their fancy taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy  they are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants  Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain s cold winters have been discovered in south west London  and one has also been detected in Surrey  Cardiff and Edinburgh   This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory   said Max Barclay  the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London who discovered the creatures in the UK  The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain  causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels  But the two new species  otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola  not previously known north of Switzerland  are now prevalent in south London   It s very likely these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental plants from Italy   said Dr Barclay   It looks like they re here to stay   He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store in       but as the shop sold imported house plants  he assumed it was a migrant  It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south west London  The second invader is not so numerous  but has established itself firmly in the same area  Apart from laurels  vine weevils attack bay  viburnum  ornamental ivy  and grape vines  An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves  The soil dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface  One possible explanation for the invaders  successful colonisation of Britain is global warming  Earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact                             Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           Sell a Home with Ease                                                                              To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to        Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to
