xine problemsHi    I m no longer able to play encrypted dvd s using the xine rpm from freshrpms   I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd s  worked just  fine  but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms  it won t  anymore   The output is    input dvd  Sorry  this plugin doesn t play encrypted DVDs  The legal status            of CSS decryption is unclear and we can t provide such code             Please check   for more information   I m pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release    Any way of  rolling back updates    Nick Verhaegen                                                  RPM List mailing list
