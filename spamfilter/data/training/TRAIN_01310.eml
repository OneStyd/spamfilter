Re  xorg synaptics driver no longer working with udev On Thu  Apr          at                 Sjoerd Hardeman wrote            Hal is certainly no longer working  see          Yet  udev now also   stopped working     OK  I think I understand a little bit better how this is supposed to be working now  Try to add your touchpad options to the InputClass section of the file  usr lib X   xorg conf d    synaptics conf as a first test   There seems to be a new mechanism that allows for multiple such InputClass sections matching the same device  so that its configuration can be spread over several files  with each file being able to add options and to override settings made in previous files  If this works as advertised then it should be possible to add your customizations in a separate InputClass section in  say     local conf and thus make sure that they are not overwritten when the synaptics driver is upgraded  That seems to have all the modularity advantages of the earlier hal udev methods with the added bonus of the simpler xorg conf syntax   I am curious to hear if this actually works because I cannot try it myself   My up to date Sid desktop does not have a touchpad        Regards                         Florian           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
