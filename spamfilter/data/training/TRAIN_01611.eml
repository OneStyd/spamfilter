Re  X server starts on the wrong console  was  New monitor  how to  change screen resolution  On Thu     Apr                      EDT   Redalert Commander wrote    On Thu             at              Alan Ianson wrote     On Thu             at              Stephen Powell wrote           Then  in theory  restarting the X server again      such as with  etc init d gdm restart  should cause the X server     to restart on vt     This used to work  but the last time I tried     it I ended up with two X servers  one on VT   and one on VT        I had to reboot to clean things up   This situation is a mess and     seems to be getting worse   As long as you login to GNOME only once     per boot and shutdown the system from GNOME you won t have this     problem   The initial allocation of VT   after a reboot works fine      But if you logout of GNOME after logging in  you re likely to have     this problem   It doesn t seem to fail all the time  though   Perhaps     it is a timing related problem         I ve noticed this too lately  although i use the nvidia driver created    by module assistant         I wonder if anyone not using the nv or nvidia driver also see this       I seem to have this all the time  even right after booting  although      I have   displays  and   ports on my GPU  so I often switch them  after   doing so  I copy the relevant xorg conf to it s proper location  and   restart gdm  In doing so  I only log in into the first console  using   ctrl alt F   do the copy and  etc init d gdm restart  at this point x is   running in VT   not    Up till this point  I haven t logged in to gnome   But the key is restarting the X server  not necessarily a logout and login to the GNOME desktop   A login logout sequence is simply the most common way to restart the X server   The X server can only start once safely   After that  who knows what VT it will end up on  and what parts of the old instance of the server will get terminated   Has anyone seen something like this on a non Nvidia driver  not nv and not nvidia                    Stephen Powell                                  To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
