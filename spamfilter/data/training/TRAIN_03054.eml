Ringing bell on other computer Hi   succeeded in ringing a bell anytime I get a mail to my inbox  Not Mailing lists  spams etc   by using procmail to execute a  play clink wav  on the  right  mails  Now my demands are growing     I use my laptop remotely very often and now I would like the bell to sound on that when I am there  I triedto use the KDE remote sound server and it works in the tests  but when procmail runs it it doesn t  presumably as it doesn t have the authorization to communicate with the laptop  beeing another user   Any hints   BRGDS       Dag Nygren                               email    Oy Espoon NewTech Ab                     phone                 Tr sktorpet                                fax                       ESBO                              Mobile                  FINLAND                                                     Exmh users mailing list
