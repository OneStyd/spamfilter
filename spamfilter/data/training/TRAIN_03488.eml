Re  device namesOn Tuesday    April               Frank McCormick wrote    I recently installed Ubuntu       on the  other  partition on my   hd    dev hda   and came across a problem no one on the   Ubuntu forums could really resolve    Grub  was installed at the same time as Ubuntu  and the whole   installation worked fine  for Ubuntu    However Grub  could not boot Debian Squeeze on  dev hda     Update grub kept putting  dev sda  in its grub cfg and Squeeze   could not boot from that  It also did not use UUIDs for Debian   despite the face that seems to be the default    Grub  is installed in the MBR         The only solution I could find after days was to install Grub  from   Debian  again in the MBR  Its config boots both fine  using UUIDs         Is this a Grub bug in Ubuntu  or will Debian eventually start   calling HD partitions by the same syntax   The kernel from lenny backports  testing  or sid will probably be using the      same device naming as Ubuntu   Likely it is not using UUIDs trying to be compatible with initramfs es or    other systems that don t like them   But  as you ve seen  using the  raw     device name doesn t really help either   Different kernel versions  and eve  n    kernels compiled with different options  will use different  raw  names for      the devices   In odd setups  the device name might change from boot to boot   as    devices are  now  discovered asynchronously so they may be assigned names i  n a    different order based how quickly they respond to the kernel    D     Boyd Stephen Smith Jr                 D         D                     o o      ICQ         YM AIM  DaTwinkDaddy                                        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvXPIUACgkQdNbfk   fC  aACfVY nRiRRU PBQ RaQC bCh Z hzgAn TAGSBOhaV aJVjo  KmG b o i  jlzj      END PGP SIGNATURE
