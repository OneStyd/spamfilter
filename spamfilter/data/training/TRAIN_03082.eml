Microsoft redesignURL    Date            T                 Jeffrey Zeldman   Party like it s                 Microsoft has redesigned   Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the  mid     s      When a W C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS  ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site  you have to  wonder who didn t get the memo           The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests     the home  page contains    instances of images without ALT text  This is the same basic  failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was  successfully sued in            Here is what microsoft com looks like in a text only browser      To better  understand the experience  take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor  except for the top line  then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one  line at a time   While nothing is technically locked out  all the links are  regular links  nothing requires Javascript to function properly   all the  un ALT enhanced images  which are mostly spacer images and images as bullets   add so much clutter to the page that it s very difficult to navigate    Meanwhile  I don t want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen  reader  Want to find the search box  That s         pttrans dot gif  pttrans  dot gif search for  pttrans dot gif  pttrans dot gif form edit box  pttrans dot  gif submit button go  pttrans dot gif link advanced search  pttrans dot gif             And I hope you weren t looking for Microsoft s accessibility home  page     it s the   th link on the page  out of
