Re  Don t be too quick to assume that  XX  UseCompressedOops is a  good thingCan you post some details  I haven t done any serious benchmarking  but I haven t seen a scenario where something  seemed  significantly slower  and in all cases I ve tried  GUI applications and J EE applications  the memory footprint was significantly smaller   I imagine a codebase that would not benefit much from compressed OOPs would be one relying primarily on manipulating primitive data types  but in that scenario I don t see how performance would be impacted  I d love to see your data  and if anyone has some insight on the potential performance tradeoffs with compressed OOPs  please share       Erik   On Apr           at      PM  Benson Margulies wrote     A quick benchmark of some CPU intensive code of ours shows a quite marked slowdown with that option turned on                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
