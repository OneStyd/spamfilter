Re  Filesystem recommendationsOn                 AM  B  Alexander wrote    Hi      I have a question on filesystems  Back in the day  I started using    reiser   It was faster than ext   and it could be extended without    umounting the filesystem  which has since been fixed in ext    plus     unlike any filesystem I have encountered  it could be reduced in size      Well  now reiser  is very long in the tooth  reiser  will probably    never go anywhere  so I m wondering what filesystems are recommended     Last I heard  ext  is stablizing  but it had problems with filesystem    corruption  though that was mid fall last year  IIRC      So now  I would like to slowly start replacing my reiser  partitions    with   something else  There are two options  the old standards  e g     ext     xfs  etc  and then there are a slew of new filesystems  such    as nilfs   btrfs and exofs      I m talking about a range of machines  from workstations to servers to    NFS and storage servers with multi terabyte disks  and a backup server    with several hundred gigs of backups      Does anyone have suggestions and practical experience with the pros    and cons of the various filesystems      Thanks      b  If file integrity are important to you  look for a FS that keeps  checksums of individual files   Otherwise  if a file becomes corrupted   you ll never know it  unless you keep your own checksums   There are  only a small handful of filesystems that keep checksums of your files    Btrfs and ZFS come to mind   I believe ZFS is more mature than Btrfs   but it isn t in the kernel   I believe the only way to get ZFS on Linux  is through FUSE   There s also JFS  which has been around for a number of years  and is  mature   It doesn t checksum your files  but it does use copy on write   as do Btrfs and ZFS   which goes a long way to keeping your data from  getting corrupted  something XFS does not do   So if Btrfs were more mature  or if ZFS were included in the kernel  I d  recommend either of those   But as it is  I think JFS is the way to go      Kevin       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
