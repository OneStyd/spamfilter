Re  Umont ownership On Tue     Apr                      Stephen Powell wrote     On Tue    Apr                      EDT   Camale  n wrote      My  fstab                 Well  I see three entries with the  user  option  but none of them   appear to be related to mount points for USB devices   It would appear   that some sort of system daemon with root privileges is issuing the   actual  mount  and  umount  commands   The hot plug event causes the   mount  so the system doesn t associate that with any particular user     How does it know who plugged the device in   It doesn t    But the   umount is requested by a specific user through a desktop icon   Note the device  mount  options  automatically added by hal        dev sdc  on  media disk type vfat  rw nosuid nodev uhelper hal shortname lower uid            nosuid  nodev  uhelper hal  uid       Maybe the perms of the OP s device are wrong        Perhaps the system daemon that I speak of is D Bus  and it decides   whether or not to allow the umount depending on what group s  the user   belongs to   And his missing  etc group file is probably the key   We still don t know if  umount  works when logged with another user in a  GNOME session      Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
