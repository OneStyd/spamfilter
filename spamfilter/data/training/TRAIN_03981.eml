Re  Flash is open On Thu     May                      Celejar wrote     Adobe claims that they publish the Flash specs                  Mmmm  and there are others that think this is not enough                 One reason for the lack of excitement over the project in the free  software world is that it omits  huge amounts  of information needed for  a complete implementation of Flash  In particular  Savoye points out that  the announcement contains no mention of the Real Time Messaging Protocol  RTMP  that is required for the Flash media server  Nor does it mention  the Sorenson Spark Codec that is used for video encoding in Flash   and     and remains the choice of some users still for Flash video because  other formats convert easily to it  Both may be encumbered by patents  but  without them  the information that Adobe has released is of limited  use      I always thought that the reason for all the trouble with Flash on Linux   is that Flash was a closed standard   If the spec is published  why are   the FLOSS players so far behind Adobe s player   Is it just that   difficult to design a good player   As per the above link  it seems not all the specs have been released or  made publicly available  There are also some concerns about software  patents  for using  and distributing  MP  codecs or FLV    Anyway  I agree with your  hidden demand       Look at PDF  PDF became a ISO IEC standard but we  at linux  still lack  for a PDF editor that can compete with Acrobat Professional    Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
