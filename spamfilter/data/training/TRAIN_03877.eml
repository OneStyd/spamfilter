Re  How to Find a Printer Driver Stephen Powell wrote    On Mon     May                      EDT   Kent West wrote          Something I ve never figured out with Debian is how to know which     package to install to get a certain printer driver        I know I ve printed to this HP Color Laserjet CM     from a Debian box     before  but I have no idea what package I had installed to do so  nor     what driver I chose  since I can t find the CM     listed in my     web based CUPS setup  localhost              I m unsure if I don t have the right package installed  or if I used a     different driver in the past  Google and the Debian search engines are     not helping me one whit        I ve never really understood the relationship between printer drivers     for general use and printer drivers for gutenprint  whatever that is       or the relationship between those and or cup driver gutenprint and or     cupsys driver gutenprint  and the descriptions are less than helpful       so any help would be appreciated        Thanks              What release of Debian are you using   Lenny   Squeeze   Sid        Lenny     I ve experienced what you describe before  mainly because older releases   of Debian used the lpr lpd printing setup  and I used apsfilter to   install printer drivers   Then when I switched to a newer release of   Debian that used CUPS  and foomatic did not have a driver for the printer    especially for older or less popular printers        and   are good places   to start looking for documentation        But that s going outside of the Debian box  I can do that  but I tend to  think Debian should have everything needed for non proprietary stuff   Maybe I expect too much from the Debian packaging documentation        Kent West          Praise Yah   o         To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
