How to stop Firefox from displaying large favicon Greetings   I have looked for ways to fix this problem several times in  the passed few months and have had no success   Recently several companies have started displaying a large  favicon in the address bar when you go to their site  In  several cases it takes up over half of the space in the  address bar and makes it extremely difficult to read the URL   One site even claimed that this is a  security feature  as  it would enable the users to tell they were really on the  bank s site and not some scammer of phisher site  Sure  Like  nobody else could figure out how to do that   Anyway  can anyone tell me how to get rid of these eyesores  I have already set browser chrome favicons and  browser chrome site icons to false and  browser chrome image icons max size to    but no difference   TIA for any help   Dennis       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
