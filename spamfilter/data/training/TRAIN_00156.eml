Re  Keyboard gets stuck when closing PPPOn Wed  Apr          at         PM        Rodolfo Medina wrote      The problem is reported here                   Does anyone know if it has been fixed  and how   I don t have the    possibility of installing Sid      A  F  Cano    writes     Don t know if it s been fixed   Most likely not in lenny and the   standard kernels   I encounter this problem much too often and each time   it requires a hard reboot   Strangely  the mouse still works so I can   log out of kde  but then the shutdown process hangs until I hit   CTRL ALT DEL   Then it continues  but the laptop doesn t shut down all   the way   I have to hold the power button for    seconds and then it   does shut down   This is a very low level issue      I don t use kppp   This happens with regular pon poff   I suspect   it s related to the cdc acm driver which is the one being used by my   phone  motorola e     through a usb cable   It s not      repeatable    I suspect something in the close routine is overwriting part of the   keyboard driver  but only some times   BTW  this is on a Dell         with the nvidia legacy driver    Maybe installing a new version of the kernel would fix it   Haven t you tried  A    Rodolfo       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
