Re  AUGD  Have You Thanked Your Volunteers My current group is too small to worry about thanking them in any     major way   Of we all thank each other   We have   regular volunteers       and currently having a different member each month volunteering to do       a presentation   Only occasionally having an outside speaker      Sometimes via iChat   When I was with HAUS in Honolulu  we thanked the volunteers by buying       them pizza each month at the board meetings   In Boston  we had an     annual meeting of  activists        strong   Then we had an annual     picnic for volunteers as well   I think it never hurts to thank people every chance you can get   Lynn    Sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who       are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it     Mark Twain  Lynn Wegley      On Apr           at       AM  Nicholas Pyers wrote     Here in Australia  May   th to   th       is National Volunteer Week          NVW      the largest celebration of volunteers and volunteerism in         Australia  and it provides an opportunity to highlight the role of       volunteers in our communities and to say thank you to the more than           million Australians who volunteer      Earlier this week I asked Australian Apple User Groups if they were         doing anything to thank their volunteers  and in light of Chris       Hart s query about ways of getting people onto Boards   Committees       and my response about thanking outgoing Committee members  I thought         now would also be an appropriate time to share the article with       everyone here      The article provides some ideas on WHO to thank  HOW to thank them          and WHEN it may be appropriate to thank them      You can read the article over at          If your group has done something different or interesting to thank a         member of your group  perhaps you ll share the idea with the list             Nicholas Pyers       Founder   Publisher  AppleUsers org                                                                     Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored    Augd mailing list            Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription          This email sent to                                                     Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Augd mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
