 Spambayes  understanding high false negative rate    TP  I m reading this now as that you trained on about     spam and     TP  about     ham   That s less than     of the sizes of the     TP  training sets I ve been using   Please try an experiment  train     TP  on     of each  and test once against the other     of each    Jeremy    This helps a lot   Possibly   I checked in a change to classifier py overnight  getting rid of MINCOUNT  that gave a major improvement in the f n rate too  independent of tokenization     Here are results with the stock tokenizer   Unsure what  stock tokenizer  means to you   For example  it might mean tokenizer tokenize  or mboxtest MyTokenizer tokenize     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     total false pos                     total false neg                    Note that those rates remain much higher than I got using just     of ham and     of spam   That remains A Mystery     And results from the tokenizer that looks at all headers except Date    Received  and X From    Unsure what that means too   For example   looks at  might mean you enabled Anthony s count them gimmick  and or that you re tokenizing them yourself  and or         Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     Training on        home jeremy Mail spam               hams       spams                                                                     total false pos                    total false neg                       Is it safe to conclude that avoiding any cleverness with headers is a   good thing   Since I don t know what you did  exactly  I can t guess   What you seemed to show is that you did  something  clever with headers and that doing so helped  the  after  numbers are better than the  before  numbers  right    Assuming that what you did was override what s now tokenizer Tokenizer tokenize headers with some other routine  and didn t call the base Tokenizer tokenize headers at all  then you re missing carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields  but adding many dozens of other header fields   There s no question that adding more header fields should help  tokenizer Tokenizer tokenize headers doesn t do so only because my testing corpora are such that I can t add more headers without getting major benefits for bogus reasons   Apart from all that  you said you re skipping Received   By several accounts  that may be the most valuable of all the header fields   I m  meaning tokenizer Tokenizer tokenize headers  skipping them too for the reason explained above   Offline a week or two ago  Neil Schemenauer reported good results from this scheme       ip re   re compile r   d        d        d        d              for header in msg get all  received                for ip in ip re findall header               parts   ip split                  for n in range                        yield  received         join parts  n    This makes a lot of sense to me  I just checked it in  but left it disabled for now
