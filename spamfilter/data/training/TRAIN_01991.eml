 SAdev   Bug       Errors from  perl Makefile PL                Additional Comments From                               I ve thought about this and PM FILTER needs to die  I ve now tried     multiple ways to make it just transparently work on         and failed      If anyone has any bright ideas please jump in         You see anyone upgrading from the CPAN shell will get a failure on the line            use ExtUtils  MakeMaker          Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays  I think or  read so somewhere  respectively   And the Perl error message is very clear    ExtUtils  MakeMaker version      required  this is only version        at  Makefile PL line          Because it never gets chance to reach a  WriteMakefile  line with a     PREREQ PM      ExtUtils  MakeMaker           option  So the CPAN shell     can t automatically upgrade this module  I cannot think of any way     around this     I could think of a solution  We could remove the  use  line and add the  version to PREREQ PM  After WriteMakefile   we could add the lines    require ExtUtils  MakeMaker     ExtUtils  MakeMaker  VERSION         to do per hand what  use ExtUtils  MakeMaker       does automagically   perl  Makefile PL  will die with a  Uncaught exception from user code   ExtUtils  MakeMaker version      required  this is only version        at  Makefile PL line       there but we ve got a Makefile  But I don t know if  CPAN will run the make anyway         To add insult to injury  the PM FILTER part gets run during pm to blib      which would be fine  except ExtUtils  MakeMaker doesn t let you write a     MY  pm to blib   it s non overridable  So even though we could     potentially copy the      ExtUtils  Install  pm to blib code somewhere     into the spamassassin codebase  I tried that first   we can t cause the     Makefile to call our code        We could call the preprocessor on install time  That s not a very clean  approach but could work     We can also overwrite pm to blib in the Makefile directly per postamble  We  already have a useless line  pm to blib  spamassassin doc  made  there  Adding  some commands in this section gives some make warnings   Makefile       warning  overriding commands for target  pm to blib  Makefile      warning   ignoring old commands for target  pm to blib    but does work  Not a very good  solution either       So I m  strongly  against the current use of ExtUtils  MakeMaker          usage  if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote   and     really hope we can find another way     The  use MakeMaker       error message is IMHO quite clear  so I think it s ok  to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils  MakeMaker before the SA  installation  But that s just my opinion        I ll ask on   for the best solution  They should know              You are receiving this mail because          You are on the CC list for the bug  or are watching someone who is                                                            This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven                                                    Spamassassin devel mailing list
