Re  Suggestion Question for the approx apt itutde  proxy daemonOn                  Rick Thomas wrote    Hi Eric       I just started using approx   I m really impressed   It s a great   piece of work   Thanks       Here s a question   Is it permissible possible to have two  or more    different mirrors listed as servers for the same set of archives       for example  my approx server s approx conf file has    security      volatile      debian        but the University has a fast Internet  link so I d like to use that   to connect when I can   e g  I d like to add    debian      debian    Look at man approx conf for more details on what I say here  Each of you example lines is interpreted by approx as a name value pair  Thus each line starting with debian binds a different value to the name debian  Only one can apply  They cannot all apply at once   If  instead  you change them to    debian     debia      debia     Put into your sources list three lines where you now have only one pointing to debian in you approx proxy server  the other two point to debia  and debia   also in you proxy server  You probably will get something close to what you want  Apt get or aptitude will work its way down sources list until it finds a working server and update the corresponding section of the proxy cache   But this would make approx create three separate proxy caches  one for each external repository  I think that this is not really what you want   I suggest that you look at   var cache approx  You will find one one subdirectory there for each definition line in your  etc approx conf file  You might get what you want by replacing directories debia  and debia  by symlinks that point to debian   Post a reply saying whether this works  I don t have a situation where I can test this exactly  and I d like to know   HTH       before the one for ftp us d o and have those be used by preference   unless our link to I  is down  in which case have it switch over to   the more generic ftp us        Is this possible now   Could it be added as a feature in a future   release          Thanks       Rick               To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   a   subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact       Archive            Paul E Condon                    To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
