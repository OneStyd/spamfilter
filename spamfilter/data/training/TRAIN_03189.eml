Re  Questions about RAID  On Wed April                  Stan Hoeppner wrote    You seem to posses knowledge of these things that is     degrees opposite   of fact   OLTP  or online transaction processing  is typified by retail or   web point of sale transactions or call logging by telcos   OLTP databases   are typically much more write than read heavy   OLAP  or online analytical   processing  is exclusively reads  made up entirely of search queries    Why how would you think OLTP is mostly reads   If all you re doing is appending to a log file then you re write intensive  For example  some INN servers using cycbuffs are write intensive if they can forward the articles out to the peers before they disappear from cache   OLTP databases have indices  or hash tables or whatever  that need to be read even when writing a new record   Then of course  the data that has been written needs to be used for something such as fulfillment and analysis  Both are mostly reads   Backup from the live DB is all reads   I typically saw about     reads in OLTP databases   I think this is getting off topic for debian user     Mike Bird       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
