Re  Is Firefox Iceweasel leaking On Fri     May                     Merciadri Luca wrote    I noticed on many computers with Debian  whatever the kernel        xx  xx         that  once   too much   tabs have been opened    Firefox Iceweasel becomes sluggish  slower and slower  and often   stalls after some time  I also noticed that  when becoming more and   more sluggish  it takes more and more RAM  even when all the pages   are completely loaded  Why  Am I the only person who s experiencing   this  Is there an objective explanation to this   I d had similar problem with Iceweasel on Lenny when my browser cache limit was set to a large value   But things are okay after bringing it down  to   MB    You might want to try that   Large cache slows Iceweasel down because it uses these large databases of stored history to suggest addresses in each tab s address bar   I also had a Zotero database  which used to worsen things   Girish       Girish Kulkarni   Allahabad  India           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
