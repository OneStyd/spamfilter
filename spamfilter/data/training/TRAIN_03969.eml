Re  xterm colorYou are hardcoding the    DISPLAY there    you are probably just getting   a different one    you should really look into ssh tunneling X     instead       Jeremy  On May           at        William Chops Westfield wrote          On Apr           at      AM  Jeremy Huddleston wrote           Also  this is another newbie question  but     if I use ssh to connect to my desktop      I cannot forward any X   applications into     my laptop  I tried xhost   and nothing happens            xhost    enables connection without authentication from other   systems over TCP IP and has nothing to do with ssh tunnels   Make sure   you re sshing to the remote system using  ssh  Y  and that the remote   system allows ssh tunneling in its  etc sshd config         I also recently got the latest System updates for        and had to   install X         rc  over that to get working again  not unexpected          However  I no longer seem to be able to start xwindows remotely on my   desktop  NOT via ssh tunnels  just ssh to the host with no tunneling    and do  xterm  display mymac      It fails with  cannot connect  issues    in spite of either xhost  remotesystem or even just  xhost     I don t   see any related messages on the Mac side console           Is this something in X  or something in the security update   I CAN   still ssh to my mac  so the firewall hasn t cut everything out   By the   firewall panel does look different than I remember it         Any ideas    Thanks   Bill W                                                        Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  X   users mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
