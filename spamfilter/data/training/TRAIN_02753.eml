Re  Resizing Raid   partitionsOn                  PM  Erwan David wrote     Hi         I have a setup with   disks and following raid setting         sda  sdb     md       sda  sdb     md  swap   sda  sdb     md   home        I d like to resize partitions to get more space on md  and less on md               What would bea good way to achieve this    The  best  way to acheive this would be to use LVM above your software RAID  At that point  it would be very painless  compared to what is ahead of you now  If you re curious  here would be the steps   mdadm  C  dev md   n    l    a yes  dev sd a b  pvcreate  dev md  vgcreate home  dev md  lvcreate  L  G  n swap home lvcreate  L   G  n root home lvcreate  l     FREE  n home home  Then  for giving more space to home  and less to root  boot off a live CD  and  assuming you re using ext       e fsck  dev home root resize fs  dev home root  G lvreduce  L  G  dev home root lvextend  L   G  dev home home resize fs  dev home home  That s it  However  because you chose not to use LVM  you will need to boot of a live CD that supports Linux software RAID  rebuild the array  and perform the resizing there  I m not sure if GParted supports this or not  Worth checking out  however   I would personally recommend backing up your data  and reinstalling  with LVM on top of your software RAID  You still have the redundancy  and you have the awesome flexibility of resizing volumes with great ease             E O     O   O       O   O         O     E   O     O O   O   O     O O       O O O O     O       O O   O O     O O O        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux  Comment  Public Key at    Comment  Using GnuPG with Fedora      iQEcBAEBCgAGBQJL Dy AAoJEM  Ebf BAiPJ  IALgWwc K wwDv s nDe HwDb  vd nG fpa ZtbSvyf F ib DSTtD  AElkPiFJBrwyUA  K q fUnIn RznAPhf VLoQvb R j JBxiPih ckazBlGCGLHMB MquaGZkDCsOR lZ Z  X bVIWhsoyaO  IJamrYedzcML ojU GQUIGI p VEr gyrBPQLNIDA xZqrP uBQ I pY ckyMib ukgzPsnrk  HMEks eGxHhBCejumRyqDp yScawevXE eBJYWTTRDg EVZjKvekb iPXXBkszUin TD CQivBcw sLh WpOL iD sAqX P C d OWf   HXzZ A JHNI   Xixo      END PGP SIGNATURE
