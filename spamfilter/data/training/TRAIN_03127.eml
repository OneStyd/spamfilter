Re  Flash is open On Fri     May                      Artifex Maximus wrote     On Fri  May          at      PM  Camale  n wrote      Can we  we people  make our own Flash implementation by using Adobe    Flash specs       Yes   Developers are now free to implement what is documented in the   specifications without restrictions from Adobe        I think you might separate the description of file format  free  and the   code itself  proprietary   So you can write your flash player using the   documentation but you cannot get the code of Adobe Flash Player   O k  here is what I was looking for         Oh  no  but    If W C does not trust  Flash  technology to be included    as one of their recommended standards  why should I  That is the point       Linux  FreeBSD  OSX and other OSs included in that W C standards  I   think the answer is no    Do you have trust in them    Linux  FreeBSD  OSX and other OSs  all of them include their own  licencing model  whatever it is  closed or open sourced   so I can use  the software knowing beforehand what I can  or can t  do with it   The licensing model of Flash was  very  unclear for me  that is what I  meant to say  And heck  it was recently  opened          so it s a  evolving license that could  dissolve  into something worse   Do not get me wrong  I m only saying that if I were a developer  I would  have many doubts in choosing a flash format for any of my works   Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
