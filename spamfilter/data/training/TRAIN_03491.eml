Re  FSEvents errors after the removal of a watched directoryOn May          at      PM  ext Dominic Giampaolo wrote        I create a FSEventStream with the right directories to watch      if the user adds or removes a directory  I delete the current FSEventS  tream and create a new one with the right values         Are you sure that you re properly tearing down and   releasing the old FSEvent stream before creating      the new one           Yes  I am sure of that  I printed all the steps on the output to check     Create stream       Schedule stream        Start stream     stuff happens       Stop stream          Invalidate stream           Release stream      Create stream       Schedule stream        Start stream               Stop stream          Invalidate stream           Release stream     I don t unschedule the stream from the run loop since I invalidate it     Also  is it possible that one FSEventStream gets      deleted on one thread and another is created on   another thread at the same time   Can you see if   putting all FSEventStream creation deletion on      the same thread makes the problem go away         All the stream related stuff is happening on the same thread  at least for   now   Plus  in my example  I don t create a new stream after deleting the first o  ne  since I have nothing left to watch    It seems to me the stream may not be properly closed  or it is trying to ac  cess something that doesn t exist anymore  But I am following all the steps for properly stopping and releasing the st  ream         Fabien Freling Software Engineer  Platform team Nokia  Qt Development Frameworks                                                   Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Filesystem dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
