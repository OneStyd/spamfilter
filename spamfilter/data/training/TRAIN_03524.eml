 SAtalk  OT  DNS MX Record Clarification Please This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better response to this elsewhere   I have setup two MX records  mail and bmail  for my mail server  The one I gave a     bmail  the other a     mail    bmail     I gave a    because I want all mail to go through this server to be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail     server for delivery   As I understand it  DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load balancing  but DNS MX records are used in order or prority  meaning the    before the    and only    if the    isn t available   But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the    never goes down  Why  Have I got something confused here   Thanks  V         End of Forwarded Message                 This message has been scanned for viruses and dangerous content by MailScanner at comp wiz com  and is believed to be clean                                                             This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven                                                    Spamassassin talk mailing list
