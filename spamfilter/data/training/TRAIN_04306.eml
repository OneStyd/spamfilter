repeated ATA errors debian lennyHi all   Recently a couple of new machines came to my hands  HP DL     G  with    Gb SATA hard disk  and I tried to setup a   nodes ganeti cluster with debian lenny   Default        kernel does work without any issue   I ve done a fresh installation with nothing more than the basics  vim and less      and after a aptitude install ganeti  editing xen config xsp and grub xen options  upon restarting I get the following error on the screen   Apr             virt  kernel                 ata      exception Emask  x  SAct  x  SErr  x  action  x  frozen Apr             virt  kernel                 ata      cmd a                                a  tag   pio    in Apr             virt  kernel                          cdb                                                  Apr             virt  kernel                          res                                     Emask  x   timeout  Apr             virt  kernel                 ata      status    DRDY   Apr             virt  kernel                 ata   hard resetting link Apr             virt  kernel                 ata   SATA link up     Gbps  SStatus     SControl      Apr             virt  kernel                 ata      configured for PIO  Apr             virt  kernel                 ata   EH complete  The installed versions are  linux image          xen     xen hypervisor       i    ganeti                                      lenny  ganeti instance debootstrap               drbd  utils                                    lenny   I upgraded to kernel          to see whether it solved the issue without success  I also tried booting with clocksource acpi pm  I ve also just tried acpi off  pci nosmi  and nocpi as suggests the ata kernel website without much success   I ve checked through internet and found the following      It should be solved because hipervisor version     is higher than the one solving the issue         unless redhat s version differ much from the debian ones in minnor version    which i don t think    Can anyone shed some light on this issue   Thank you in advance    Samuel  Hi all   Recently a couple of new machines came to my hands  HP DL       G  with    Gb SATA hard disk  and I tried to setup a   nodes ganeti clust  er with debian lenny   Default        kernel does work without any is  sue     I     ve done a fresh installation with nothing more than the basics  v  im and less      and after a aptitude install ganeti  editing xen config xs  p and grub xen options  upon restarting I get the following error on the sc  reen    Apr             virt  kernel    A              ata      exception Emask    x  SAct  x  SErr  x  action  x  frozen Apr             virt  kernel      A              ata      cmd a                                a  tag   pio      in  Apr             virt  kernel    A              A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  c  db                         A                          Apr             vi  rt  kernel    A              A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  res                                       Emask  x   timeout   Apr             virt  kernel    A              ata      status    DRDY   Apr             virt  kernel    A              ata   hard resetting link Apr             virt  kernel    A              ata   SATA link up     Gbp  s  SStatus     SControl       Apr             virt  kernel    A              ata      configured for PIO    Apr             virt  kernel    A              ata   EH complete  The installed versions are  linux image          xen     xen hypervi  sor       i     ganeti A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A    A  A  A  A  A  A          lenny  ganeti instance debootstrap A  A  A    A  A  A  A  A        drbd  utils A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A    A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A             lenny   I upgraded to ke  rnel          to see whether it solved the issue without success   I also tried booting with clocksource  Dacpi pm  I     ve also just tried a  cpi  Doff  pci  Dnosmi  and nocpi as suggests the ata kernel website withou  t much success   I     ve checked through internet and found the foll  owing       It should be solv  ed because hipervisor version     is higher than the one solving the issue           unless redhat     s version differ much from the debian ones in min  nor version    which i don     t think     Can anyone shed some light on this issue    Thank you in adva  nce    Samuel
