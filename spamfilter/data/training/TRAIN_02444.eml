Re  non ASCII environmentOn Fri    Apr                      EDT   John Hasler wrote    Stephen Powell writes     Yes  Hercules is an IBM mainframe emulator   But the problem is    licensing   There are some  very old  releases of IBM operating    systems that have passed into the public domain that you can run on    the Hercules emulator     These are circa      or so  which is about    years ago   An example    is VM SP Release     Oops  I meant to say VM     Release    not VM SP Release     VM SP Release   is still proprietary          These are some of the issues that someone writing portable code for ASCII vs  EBCDIC implementations needs to worry about       Collating sequence   In ASCII  the collating sequence is numbers        followed by uppercase letters  A Z   followed by lowercase letters  a z    Special characters are mixed throughout   In EBCDIC  the collating sequence is lowercase letters  a z   followed by uppercase letters  A Z   followed by numbers         So records sorted alphabetically sort in a different order       Assumptions of continuity   In ASCII  the codes a z and A Z are contiguous  with no codes in between   In EBCDIC  there are six non contiguous ranges  a i  j r  s z  A I  J R  S Z   Most of the codes in between are non printable characters  but not all   For example    sorts above r and below s    sorts above I and below J  and   sorts above R and below S       Hidden assumptions about control codes   A program may  for example  assume that X  A  is a line feed and hard code it somewhere   In ASCII  that is true   But in EBCDIC  a line feed is X             bit assumptions   In U S  standard ASCII  all the printable characters are between the hex values of X     X  F    Codes above X  F  are not standard codes   Historically  these indicate the combination of the  Meta  key with a regular code   In EBCDIC  the codes are sprinkled throughout the entire range of X     through X FF   with the numeric symbol   having the highest code of any normal printable character  X F      This is not an exhaustive list  but it gives you an idea of what to watch for   Although the following table has a few mistakes  this link will give you an idea of ASCII vs  EBCDIC codes                         Stephen Powell                                   To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
