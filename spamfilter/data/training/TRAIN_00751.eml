Re  Fwd  Re  Kde        On Mon May                  Michael Thaler wrote    In      KDE was around     Million lines of code     and had about       contributors      KDE     had less lines of code and less developers  but   the numbers are the same order of magnitude  Even if you find some people   that are willing to maintain and improve KDE      how do you want to   maintain and improve some of million lines of code which were developed by   hundreds of people  And you have to maintain Qt  as well  That is just   totally unrealistic   It may well take     people to turn KDE     into KDE     It takes far fewer to maintain a pre existing  excellent  stable code base     I don t think it is appropriate to spam the list with your request about   keeping KDE     in Debian Squeeze  even though the Debian KDE team decided   to not do that  There are lots of people who like KDE   and are happy that   the Debian KDE team does a really good job providing KDE   for Debian  I   understand thst you do not like KDE    People told you what your options   are and keeping KDE     is  for several reasons already stated  not one of   them  So please do accept that stop spamming the list with your  Rescue KDE        requests   Please don t interfere with discussions about rescuing KDE      We re not trying to stop you from running KDE     Please don t interfere with our work     Mike Bird       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
