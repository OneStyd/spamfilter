everyone                   Some   may wonder                how we can sell a computer at  when the   program                available directly from Lindows com is billed as not   completely                ready  The difference is the  any  computer in the world      that s very                difficult   It s the difference between making a single   pair of                shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with   every                style of shoe for every size foot  The first one is easy    the second                one is a much bigger job                  While the
