Re  Protocol implementation in category On Apr           at      AM  Dave Keck wrote      Just include the protocol in the category interface e g          interface MyObject FooDelegate                end        And make sure this is visible to the compiler when you set an instance    as a delegate       Ah  I was under the false impression that categories couldn t declare   themselves as implementing a protocol  This works beautifully   I ran into a problem doing this a few years ago  where calling  conformsToProtocol  would cause a hang when the protocol was  implemented in a category   That might be fixed by now  but be  careful if you check conformance       Adam                                                   Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Objc language mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
