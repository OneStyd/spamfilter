           Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter  Still  it kinda happened with    I forgot to mention that the String value s label is  Logging   sans quotes   That was almost like a cliffhanger  eh  The oversight was totally my fault  I ve been thinking about asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews  Don t be surprised if that happens soon  I m sure you d welcome a female perspective on this stuff  right  She helped one of our landlords pick a paint color for the  office  wall this evening  Does that qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the Internet  You betcha  Let s see how she does with the drapes and rugs  I have a feeling I ll be the one tweaking furniture layout  Shouldn t be too much of an issue   yet  I wonder if Ikea has an affiliate program      I ve mentioned how Yahoo Mail s beta is mangling our commas  but did you know that it s also  possibly  rewriting your e mail  If you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo com account  something may get lost in the translation  Try sending this sentence   My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate   Again  be sure this note is sent in HTML format  The results will surprise you  As far as I can tell  they re doing this to stop any scripts from being distributed to their user base  I must credit Marion Schroll for making me aware of the  problem   It s kinda funny  in a weird sort of way  Not that I would want anything I send changed in any way  shape  or form  It begs the question  what next  I mean  where does it all stop  Give them a bit  and they just might take a byte  Censorship is only a stone s throw away      I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark  who asks   What is this crazy business with the broadband metering  What they advertise doesn t seem to be what you get  Now that I m forking out     per month for a supposed metered rate of     down       up  I m feeling clueless and left out in the cold  Not sure what I m paying for  not sure what s going on at the office  not sure if I m capped  not sure if I m getting ripped off  Can you help me out here  I m feeling lied to  why can t I download  til my    gig is full  That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT I was paying for  I want consistent speed   is this too much to ask   It s not too much to ask the question  but it s probably too much to get the answer  I m facing the same dilemma right now  even though cable based connectivity isn t available in my area  Expect more and more  filters  to be put in place as time marches on  Watch those EULAs

       Directory Lister v          k  W x  k XP FREE       List directory contents  When I was younger  I d get so frustrated at those games where you d have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures  I d always end up with one or two that I just could never see  When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer  I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing  Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories  it will also let you save the output to an HTML file  This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website  As an added bonus  Directory Lister also shows the date  time  and attributes of the files in your directory  making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories        Web Calendar    k  W k XP FREE       Web page reminder  Surfing the web as much as I do  I ll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an  Under Construction  banner  I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later  or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week  The same technique holds true for my normal browsing    for example  I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning  or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week  Now  I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of

the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle flipping bartender  I never achieved my goal of being the world s best geek bartender  but maybe with College Bar I

GnomeTIP       I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts  Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book  Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode    to do this I just hit F   on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode  Hit it again and I am back to regular mode  If you aren t as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me  then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect  You will notice  however  that your Start Menu isn t anywhere to be seen  Never fear  another keyboard shortcut is here    just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs  Alternatively  if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well                          Your subscribed e mail address is        To unsubscribe or change your delivery address  please visit the   page  For further
