Re  Linux compatible mainboards     BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE      Hash  SHA   Kelly Clowers wrote        I don t know specifically about buggy bioses  but in general  Foxconn   is not a brand associated with quality  while Gigabyte  Asus and Intel are   Aside from the quality issue  two  years ago there was considerable internet chatter about BIOSes on some Foxconn models that were unfriendly to Linux   According to the Foxconn article in the Wikipedia Foxconn was forced by some of the companies which used Foxconn boards in their own brands to fix those BIOSes   In any event if the information in that article is even half true  Foxconn is a manufacturer to avoid        Intel chipsets make sense for Intel Motherboards  the days when you   needed to look to Via or someone else to provide the needed features   are mostly gone  Nvidia is  for now  still the best for more powerful   integrated graphics with Intel CPUs  But Linux users probably don t   want Nvidia graphics anyway    As I mentioned in my  another thought  post  I am planning to use a Nvidia GPU anyway  mainly in order to have two monitors      Driver wise it isn t really a matter of the north  or south  bridge  it is   about the individual chips that need drivers  Things like ATA controllers   and wired Ethernet controllers are generally a non issue nowadays    The biggest things you need to look at are the GPU  all Intel GPUs   except the mobile GMA    have good support   and wireless          chipsets  not usually built in on desktops  of course   Good to know     In the case of the GA G  M ES H  the Southbridge is old  ICH   ICH     will be out soon   and the Realtek audio and ethernet chips aren t the   greatest  Nonetheless  they do the job and shouldn t have any major   compatibly problems with recent kernels  It should be noted that   boards with newer ICHs and something other than Realtek are a   fair bit more expensive   In view of your comments I looked further into what is available locally   The model I was originally looking at was a GA G  M ES L for CA         I found however a GA EP   UD L with the ICH   and many other more advanced features including better Realtek audio for CA         As I am using an external GPU which GPU internal chipset is provided is not really an issue for me  I think the latter model is better value for the price   Regards  Ken Heard       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Using GnuPG with Mozilla      iEYEARECAAYFAkvPwf ACgkQlNlJzOkJmTfrCACggUeE  NsliUzCLAH s lXqTS VW An dPH RXXTTF f zOAGUfto lKh   IwK       END PGP SIGNATURE            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
