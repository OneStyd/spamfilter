Xorg and cpu usageHello there  I own a dell studio      with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD      I have a debian testing installation and currently I have to use either radeon or the radeonhd drivers cause the proprietary  fglrx  driver doesn t support the xserver currently available in testing  Everything works just fine  I even got  d acceleration and Kwin effects  The problem is that the xorg process is using the cpu and consuming much memory  The memory consumed is about    MB but that doesn t really bother me cause I got plenty of it  P  Well the annoying thing is the cpu fan  xorg uses about      as shown in kde s system monitor  and so the fan does never stop  Has anyone else spotted any high cpu usage when using those drivers  If I disable the kde effects the memory consumption gets lower but the cpu is still in heavy use by the xorg process    Well I got a few more questions about these open source drivers  Does anyone know if they have power saving enabled  I think when I used the fgrlx driver the battery lasted much longer  I also got an issue with suspend  It worked with the fglrx driver but with the opensource drivers the laptop doesn t wake up  Well it does but the display shows nothing  I have to play with alt ctrl f  before it shows something  Then if I type my pass I can see that the s ram process is consuming     of the cpu  One time when doing so the laptop turn off by itself  I think it overheated so that makes me think that something goes wrong with the acpi after waking up from suspend   Sorry for the long post  Thanks in advance for any help   J  Hello there  I own a dell studio      with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD      I   have a debian testing installation and currently I have to use either rade  on or the radeonhd drivers cause the proprietary  fglrx  driver doesn     t   support the xserver currently available in testing  Everything works just   fine  I even got  d acceleration and Kwin effects  The problem is that the   xorg process is using the cpu and consuming much memory  The memory consume  d is about    MB but that doesn     t really bother me cause I got plenty o  f it  P  Well the annoying thing is the cpu fan  xorg uses about      as sh  own in kde     s system monitor  and so the fan does never stop  Has anyone   else spotted any high cpu usage when using those drivers  If I disable the   kde effects the memory consumption gets lower but the cpu is still in heav  y use by the xorg process     Well I got a few more questions about these open source drivers  Do  es anyone know if they have power saving enabled  I think when I used the f  grlx driver the battery lasted much longer  I also got an issue with suspen  d  It worked with the fglrx driver but with the opensource drivers the lapt  op doesn     t wake up  Well it does but the display shows nothing  I have   to play with alt ctrl f  before it shows something  Then if I type my pass   I can see that the s ram process is consuming     of the cpu  One time when   doing so the laptop turn off by itself  I think it overheated so that make  s me think that something goes wrong with the acpi after waking up from sus  pend    Sorry for the long post  Thanks in advance for any help   J
