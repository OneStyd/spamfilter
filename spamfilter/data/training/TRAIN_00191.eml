Re   ILUG  removing liloQuoting jac          i recently had to wipe linux from my pc but forgot to restore the original   MBR  NT   Anyone know how i can do this  linux is entirely gone and no boot   floppy  formatting the entire disk doesn t do it either   The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you have in mind   It should overwrite the MBR   Indeed  the problem is usually  preventing  this from happening  as Microsoft Corporation s installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish it  without asking your permission       Cheers                 We re sorry  you have reached an imaginary number  Rick Moen             Please rotate your  phone ninety degrees and try again          Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
