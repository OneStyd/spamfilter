 May   th                                                                                                     Welcome to this year s third issue of DPN  the newsletter for the Debian community  Topics covered in this issue include       DebConf   update     Squeeze freeze     Debian Ubuntu relationship     Debian installation media and non free firmware         and much more    DebConf   update                   Deadlines are looming for DebConf     some have already passed  For example  the last day to submit a BoF  Birds of a Feather  talk has come and gone  There is still lots you can do for DebConf   however including volunteering time  lending equipment  and even donating money  Sponsors and donors are needed to help defray the costs of holding DebConf   as Raphael Geissert wrote on his blog                 Joey Hess also blogged about DebConf       saying  Let us get you to DebConf    I promise you won t regret it   There is still time  you have until the   th of May  to contact Joey about this year s special funding to get you to DebConf                Squeeze freeze                 Adam Barratt and the release team sent out an update on the status of transitions  Release Critical bugs and a Timeline of the Squeeze freeze  In short  we have a way to go before Squeeze is frozen and it is difficult for the release team to estimate when Squeeze will get frozen  Adam writes  In order to help us keep a clearer picture of which changes still need to occur before we can freeze  we will be introducing a  transition freeze  before the end of this month  If you have not yet discussed your transition with the Release Team  please ensure that you have done so before May   st    The release team is already working on some transitions now  like Qt  and gnome desktop  which are finished  The KDE team is working on KDE     with the goal of having as up to date and stable version of the KDE suite as is possible  To quote Adam   We re also close to completing the evince   totem pl parser transition  which means we re well on the way to have GNOME      in Squeeze     Even though the descending slope of theRC bug graph     is pretty impressive      we still have about     RC bugs in Squeeze  Some of them are waiting for packages to transition from unstable to testing  but there s still a large number which need working on  On this every DD can help out by NMUing packages which are currently affected by RC bugs  Please remember that releasing is a collective effort and it is not enough to just have your own packages RC bug free  although it s a good start  to be able to release  So  if you can help  please choose an RC bug      fix it     and NMU it  possibly to the DELAYED queue so that the maintainer can react if needed                        Debian Ubuntu relationship                             Being invited to the recent Ubuntu Developer Summit  Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli gathered feedback      and examples about the relationship between the two projects  Most interesting where of course success stories   epic fails  and requests from the Debian Project at large to the Ubuntu community  Later he posted a link to his slided       a video is also available       also containing some figures  e g  that roughly     of all packages in Ubuntu are taken without further patches directly from Debian  Stefano later posted a summary of his talk      and the feedback he got                                             Debian installation media and non free firmware                                                  With Debian s Kernel Team moving firmware files  binary data needed for some hardware like network interface cards  in separate packages in Debian s non free section  Kurt Roeckx wondered       if that approach could lead to usage problems especially during installation and if these files should be added to the installation media  Several people pointed out  that the debian installation system already supports loading firmware      from a separate installation media  e g  a USB stick  That however would still be to complicate for many users or use cases  e g  remote installation   In the end Steve Langasek proposed      to offer normal installation media without non free firmware files and an easy to use tool  which would add the distributable non free firmware files to the installation media image                                   Other news             The   nd issue of the miscellaneous news for developers      has been released and covers the following topics
