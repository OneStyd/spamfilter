Re  KDE    KDE     Gnome    Gnome Alan Ianson wrote     On Tue May                  am deloptes wrote        Don t understand me wrong  I am for improvement and progress but not the    way kde  is pushing it to the end user       If there was enough interest  kde  could continue to be developed as it s   own project       I would support the project but I can t contribute anything more than bug   reports since I am just a user and not a programmer   I remember I asked on kde develop and they said they don t have the ressources to support it  But what I mean is that someone should care to get the code compiled on newer libraries  This could be challenging though if the code is working ATM  it s not that much effort to keep it running at least for the next few years   The interest is present I think  but not in the focus of interest of kde management development team  I personally could and will make a repo for my needs     but it does not seem to be urgent ATM  If someone starts similar project I would love to know and join   Hm  so we have to think about doing something like kde     for debian squeeze  I personally hate k ubuntu but there are few very useful features in the      version there   This plan could cover     years  And in that time kde  should have matured enough to fit our needs   As far as I know kde  is not in squeeze  apps are supported but framework not  or am I wrong   What do you think   regards       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
