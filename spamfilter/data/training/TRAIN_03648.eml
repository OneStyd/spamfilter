Re  Fwd  Re  Kde        On Friday    May               Sjoerd Hardeman wrote    Please do not judge KDE  by not being a copy of KDE      If that was the   case  there would be no point in making a new version anyway  The   important question is whether KDE lacks functionality that should be   there  this includes  but is not limited to  functionality present in   KDE   be bothered if the functionality  looks  different  Again  if all the   functionality would look the same  there would be no point creating a   new version   No   that is the problem    I loved KDE     x and have become quite slick with  it   KDE   is different   I don t like it   If I have to  in effect  change  DE  and go through the learning curve again  there is no reason why it would  have to be to KDE     When the time comes that I cannot sensibly go on using  KDE    I shall chose where I go next on the basis of what the options are  looking like at the time   I can see little liklihood that that choice will  be KDE     I may even switch to a window manager without a DE  and chose  other ways of working  if that is the only way that I can avoid the glitz  that is now all the rage   How things look is very important to me   I have problems with my eyes  and  how a thing looks can influence whether I can work on a thing for one minute   ten minutes or an hour   I have no problem with other people liking and wanting to use KDE     I have a  problem with their  in some cases  not allowing me the freedom  not  to use  it   And I personally shall mourn the passing of KDE     Lisi       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
