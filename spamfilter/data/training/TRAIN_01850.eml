Re  Kde             BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE      Hash  SHA   On Thursday    May      it was so written    So  let me ask the above question again  where is your code    I was thinking about getting all obsequious and fawning at the High  Priests of Development  to verbally bow in thanks for the scraps of  code that we mere users are able to pick up off the ground after the  Priests have passed  but then I realized that there are lots of  people for whom English isn t a first language  and sarcasm doesn t  work in email very well anyway   What s left for a user to do  As Nate put it a moment ago  just move  on     Are  you  interested in doing it    Backporting KDE  applications to a KDE  working environment is beyond  my skills  I can t even get Squeeze KDM to use a different background  as it is     At that game  there are two types of players  those who rant and   contribute to fix the root of their rant  aka code  and those who   rant and do nothing   Going back to obsequious pandering is looking very tempting  Yes  us  mere users have nothing to contribute  since we don t write code     We are all volunteers and among those volunteers  nobody is   interested in maintaining KDE     within Debian  I don t see this   as a problem  its just a fact   Indeed  And I assure you  that fact is not lost on anyone     Ranting wont change the facts   Let them eat cake     OdyX  Curt           Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end  for they do so with the approval of their consciences       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux   iQEVAwUBS LLAC Y  yItIgBAQKlVwf TpRme P nghvduVJ  Lao  ejEA Vdro AdkSgUIHkxYx PzcW qISXkC VL ZWz ZZCxXn o Z C     tif A tpaeISPfg lgC RSNRLZIGOqo t iWWp cCWbnPMP GZaq PRh AaFDvk bJ KdP Wg JjK xE iilXzb S gOYlacvJ f  Nv sQJMsLFcqlS g F mKkAEKWERwI Y  nCunJvdEw     K ZWWAv HMR iaWmiX  pg vOru KewLw  OesEbdPF  WhCpHqAZHHr ep  wcP  A uYa s wC KhGuZ V  Bfgm ZL K WcTrXhoLXS RbJhGYEA    svYH      END PGP SIGNATURE            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
