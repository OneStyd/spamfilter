Re   ILUG  CVS question Well  as many have said  it s non trivial and not smart enough   I did try just cvs ing over the existing sources  but cvs complained that my  files were in the way   Then I thought that I d only need the DRI stuff  that took about     hours to  fetch    M  Unfortunately I still need the XFree   cvs stuff as well     At     M that took almost   hours   Now I can start building the XFree   cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the  D  patches for my GVX  card  I just hope I don t completely trash my system in  the process    Think I ll wait until morning to start building  though  I ve been building a  new box from source this week  A    Mhz PentiumMMX with   M  It took a full  day to build XFree         and     days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs   kdebase took just under    hours  I ve got lots of grief from the wife for  the computer running  round the clock this week  The rest of KDE should build  in under    hour increments   Cheers    John Gay       Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
