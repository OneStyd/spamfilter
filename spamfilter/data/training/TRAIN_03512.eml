Re  network setup questionOn                AM  Alex Samad wrote      well think about it  if we are talking about network                    for my example I will use    instead of         the server would have an address                   for example  and the   router would have                     if I change the netmask of the server it can no longer talk to the   router because it is in a different ip network ie                  can t   talk to                  you can fake it on linux with iproute   see my   other answer to this thread          Sorry if I m being dense  I said I m not a networking expert   But I  have thought about this  and I am not seeing how it wouldn t work                is                                                     is                                       So  the computer at               will think it s subnet is the first     bits of the address  which is                           which matches  the first    bits of the router address   So far so good   Client side  will think the machine at              is on the same IP subnet  so it  will do an ARP request for               ARP doesn t care about subnet  masks  it just does an Ethernet broadcast   which will succeed  and the  server will be able to send to the router   The reverse direction is  also true   What am I missing        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
