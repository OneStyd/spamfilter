Re  akonadi first time start bugs with KDE      Am Donnerstag    Mai      schrieb Frederik Schwarzer     Martin Steigerwald   Donnerstag    Mai                         Hi             JFYI as this might  partly  be packaging related             I found the following bugs with Akonadi since I upgraded to KDE           happening often  possibly always when I start Kontact for the first     time after starting a KDE session  On further starts of Kontact it     works as          expected    Umm  that s interesting  I had this since KDE        self compiled  and   it vanished when switching from the       debs to the       ones    So I thought it was just fixed for        Now I wonder what I did to   make it work   Well  Thats what I mean  Do you  understand  whats going on there   I am a Linux trainer  consultant and administrator since    years and    still don t get  why  this happen and  what  it triggers  I might get it    when I study MySQL  DBUS  Resource Agents  Nepomuk   whatever  else it    uses   but I am and I want to be  just a user  of this stuff      So I think this is for upstream to solve   and if it ain t work reliably    in KDE     I think it has to be fixed within KDE     series  Akonadi might      use MySQL or not  but it if uses it  KAddressBook should still just work     predictably    Thus I suggest reporting anything like that upstream   especially to you     Boyd   complaining here probably just won t help  And if upstream does not      get bug reports they probably don t even know that something is broken on    probably only  some  systems   Some issues might be packaging related  but then I hope to get hints back    from upstream developers so that I can file debian bug reports with proper      suggestions  Until then I think I default to reporting upstream  unless    someone convinces me to do elsewise   Ciao    D     Martin  Helios  Steigerwald     GPG    B   D C            AFA  B  F    B EAAC A      C        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvilPQACgkQmRvqrKWZhMcgGACfQE nCwt zKeAaNspePEZTVMz im AnAsmXVwf ElUNEWQSIrp XOskE D    z       END PGP SIGNATURE
