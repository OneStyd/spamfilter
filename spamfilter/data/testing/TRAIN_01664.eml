the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday s Penguin Shell  The response has been great  with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes  It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause  Know that whether you answered the call or not  you re in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks  I ve not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered  but I ll certainly keep you posted on the outcome    Second  a few final clarifications on the  th of July bruhaha  A reader brought to my attention that  though he didn t believe it to be the case  offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling  That certainly wasn t intended  Also  I ve seen much email over the past week that started with   Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US  I d expect that you ll publish an opinion in disagreement   Well  I did that already   it was my own opinion that started the discussion  I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand  So  this will be the last word on the subject  Thanks for your opinions and your discussion  the vast majority of which was well thought and reasonable  Both sides were presented and we re moving on    On to some Lockergnome news  If you haven t already heard    CleverMedia  is sponsoring karaoke night at  Gnomedex   According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex  Lori Lockwood   There is definitely a  surprise  in the works for the attendees       Hmmm  Could it even compare to last year s Miss Gnomedex contest  I think it unlikely  In any regard  the folks at CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun    it s what they do for a living  Between  Leo Laporte    Doc Searls    Steve Gibson    Mark Thompson    Evan Williams   and too many others to mention  you d be silly to miss out    Onward  Have a great day       Tony

don t want to mince any words  here   CodeWeavers  has really hit a sweet spot with their recently released  CrossOver Office  product  This is  quite simply  the fulfillment of the promise of the  Wine Project   Using this slick little app  virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux  Frankly  I never thought I d see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting  Maybe it s time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands    Let s break this product up a bit  If purchased as a bundle  both CrossOver Office and  CrossOver Plugin   as we discussed yesterday  share an install script  They do  however  require separate install processes  so they need to be launched individually from a shared window    I started the CrossOver Office install  dropped my Office      disc in the CD drive  and fired up the install  It looked and performed exactly as you d expect to see it in Windows  I was able to customize the install  as I always have  then let it run  At the end of the process  CrossOver Office  fakes  a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete    Even Internet Explorer     is installed  There s an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE     but  to my chagrin  this was the one area of the install that failed  Actually  the install itself may have succeeded   I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade  It s hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office  or in the IE program itself    For the most part  these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows  The IE install was a bit kludgy  with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar  Word worked perfectly  allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend s business without so much as a hiccup  Even printing works well with the installation of a  Wine Postscript Printer  driver    Let me reiterate something I said yesterday  I ve watched the Wine Project walk  then crawl  then walk again over the past few years  I ve always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent  With the financial backing of CodeWeavers  it appears that my suspicions were well founded  Wine has  through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin  matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience  In the big picture  widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux  the loss of Word and Excel  They simply don t need to fear those losses any more    A note on the  for pay  structure of these products seems in order  As you well know  I m an open source guy through and through  But  this is clearly a case in which the  free  efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn t enough to close the gap  The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost  And  if it keeps these developers moving forward  it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux           Send us a GnomeTWEAK             nbsp GnomeCORE        Kernel Configuration   Part X    Today we re looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration    There s really not much mystery to it  This section simply asks the question   Do you want plug and play support in the kernel   In other words  do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you ll ever need to have  If you re set solid with your current machine  there s no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system s kernel code  or as a loadable module  If  on the other hand  you ve got PCI or  on an older system  ISA slots just begging to be filled  build this support into the kernel or select it as modules    See  this kernel gig isn t really so tough  In fairness  we re hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings  The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell  But  so far  the configuration has been pretty straightforward    Tomorrow  we  will  dive a bit deeper  with a discussion of block device kernel
