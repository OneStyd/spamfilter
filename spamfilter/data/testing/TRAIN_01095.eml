Re  About USB hard drives and errorsOn                  Stan Hoeppner wrote    Paul E Condon put forth on                 PM         So  the fact that my WD drives don t play well with S M A R T doesn t      make them special  and I should not spend much  if any  time looking     for a USB solution  What other options are there for external HD       You re got   USB hard drives already  and you re throwing them out and   looking for another solution  just because they don t do S M A R T   If   neither USB nor firewire do smart  you choices are very limited   Well  the sad story is that I don t really want to do S M A R T  I was experiencing disk errors on the drives which caused something in the kernel to throw a fit  When this happened  the only recovery I could find was to reboot  This is slow and not really a way to learn how to fix the problem  So I ask for advice on this list  I work down the list of suggestions  not having much success  and arrive at smartctl  But now we know that that doesn t work for reasons that I might have known if I had read the whole of wikipedia and had total recall     but I hadn t and I don t   Since my last post  I have succeeded in doing a successful  error free  backup to each of the disks  One notable fact about all the errors is that after reboot it would appear that no data was lost and the backup could be resumed from where it advanced to just before the crash  The only thing that I can think that I did differently in these new successful runs is that I did not sit at the computer and watch  Can software detect being watched  I think not  but      My reading about eSATA gives me suspicion that it has its own poorly documented problems  I m not convinced that I cannot make USB work without S M A R T  but I really don t have any good ideas as to how  And now  without errors happening fairly frequently  I doubt that I will be able to test and debug any approach that I dream up        The only other realistic option I know of is eSATA  but a quick scan of   Newegg shows only   devices total    DVR expander drives and   eSATA RAID   enclosures   I have no idea if the DVR expander drives will work with a   standard PC setup   They  should    The two DVR drives are both  TB and both   just under      USD  one Iomega and one Western Digital                  Are you planning on connecting this drive to a laptop or desktop   To   multiple computers or just one computer   This is for a LAN of desktop systems  three computers in all  One computer acts as a collector of backups from the itself and the other two  and is responsible for getting the files onto an external drive in a timely way   All of the computers are hand me downs  None have eSATA capability  So far I have not convinced myself that spending money would help solve the problem  Perhaps in a few years  computers with eSATA will start showing up in dumpsters  Maybe I should just wait       Paul E Condon                    To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
