Re  KDE       upgrade eats     MB of  homeOn Wednesday              Mike Kasick wrote    On Wed  May          at         AM        Richard Hartmann wrote          Disable  kres migrator    Or at least add a debconf option to        kdepim runtime presenting the option of running kres migrator by       default or disabling it             Did you do any research as to what the longer term implications     of foregoing this might be  I am not saying there are any  I     honestly don t know         There shouldn t be any long term implications as long as the old KResource   code still exists   I m assuming it s being deprecated as of KDE      but   I d be surprised if it s removed in KDE      especially since delaying   migration is an official recommendation   The KResource API is public API of KDE   it can at best removed at the firs  t    KDE  version  which is probably still several years away   Some of its plugins are public API as well  those from kdepimlibs  so they      stay too  Problematic are plugins from kdepim  they can be replaced by respective    Akonadi base resource implementations     Once the DB mess is sorted out  KDE        one can manually migrate the   data by running  kres migrator    I actually did this accidentally   The   migrator  might  also run if we remove the configuration bit  but I ve not   tried   Right  I think it will run if it does not find its configuration  thus not      knowing whether it has already run  Could lead to duplicated resources on Akonadi side though  if it has been r  un    before    Cheers  Kevin       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iD DBQBL  YhnKMhG pzZJIRAqbgAJ VXrn HvAzWo  JMp X  ymKkJawCdEVKi fUEH bs  ehka XQM  jkso   jNrC      END PGP SIGNATURE
