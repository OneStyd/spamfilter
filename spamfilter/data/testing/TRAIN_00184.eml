 ILUG  Training in Ireland  Hi   This might appear as a very strange email  Maybe it is     I m french  and I m currently studying in a engineer school in France  called UTBM      Next year  from February to July  I have to do a practice somewhere in the world  in France or elsewhere    I m a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now  I coordinate the KOS project      That s why I m looking for a practice in which I can use Linux and or develop Linux BSD Software  I also prefer working in a small company        people   But since I ve never been to Ireland  that s why I want to discover this country   and since I have no contact there  it is very difficult to find companies   So  I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by giving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux BSD or any other free software   Thank you very much for your help  Thomas  Thomas Petazzoni thomas   KOS     Perso           Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
