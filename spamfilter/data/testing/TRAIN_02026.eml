Re  results for giant mass check  phew I never claimed it could learn  all  combinatorial  possibilities  but it certainly can learn some   C  On Thursday  August           at        PM  Scott A Crosby wrote     On Thu     Aug                      Craig R Hughes      writes       It  can  learn combinatorial stuff in a more subtle way   Imagine     No it can t       It can learn a few examples that happen to be linearily seperable    like those you gave  It cannot learn the example I gave below  which   is not linearily seperable
