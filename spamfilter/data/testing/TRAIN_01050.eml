Re  The future of  nv  driver  was  Linux compatible mainboards  another thought On Monday    April               Celejar wrote    On Mon     Apr                        Boyd Stephen Smith Jr     wrote      On Monday    April               Celejar wrote        What makes the non free firmware question particularly interesting is       that the alternative is often to hardcode the functionality into the       hardware   Now  if you had a board with completely closed HW  but that       presented an open  well documented interface for the driver  most       people would be very happy  although there are  of course  the open       hardware crusaders   more power to them     So  now that they ve simp  ly       implemented some of that functionality in SW  in the form of firmware       which the driver installs on the card  but which has nothing to do wi  th       your host machine  are you really any worse off          As a distributor you may very well be   If you can t provide the source     code  you can t satisfy the terms of the GPL  usually             We re talking about firmware for things like wireless cards  produced   by the HW manufacturers  e g   Broadcom   Where does the GPL enter into   this   Some are included in the tarball provided by the Linux kernel team  which i  s    distributed under the GPLv    In particular  I am thinking of the iwl        firmware that is required to run my wireless card   It doesn t matter what upstream wants to call source code   The GPL v      defines it as the preferred form for making modifications    GPLv   section           It is unlikely that the firmware was written in a hex editor  or    equivalent    Most likely it is C source for a freestanding  non hosted     environment with some manufacturer specific libraries  but it could also be   in    some manufacturer specific assembly code   Either form would be better for      making modifications than a binary blob    D     Boyd Stephen Smith Jr                 D         D                     o o      ICQ         YM AIM  DaTwinkDaddy                                        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvWDZ ACgkQdNbfk   fC IpgCdFirh vK u IDXQqp bmXz QN oJ An Jb  hvy Jt H IRfCYoFb xt f  w         END PGP SIGNATURE
