Re  ICMCompressionSession question   I have no idea what that s supposed to mean  You d use a   decompression session and do whatever you want with the pixel buffers it   gives you  Why do you think you can t   I believe this is a newbie question related to the general use of the   decompression session  Let me try to explain      First I initialize my decompression session within the data proc   callback function          START            if  videoData  decompressionSession   D  D NULL        cout  width    videoData  height k  BGRAPixelFormat                                     displayAndCompressFrame  videoData                                      videoData  decompressionSession        if  err   D  D    cout  compressionSession   D  D NULL        cout  width  videoData  height    videoData  codecType                                     videoData  averageDataRate    videoData  timeScale                                  useCompressedFrame  videoData                                   videoData  compressionSession        if  err   D  D    cout  decompressionSession                           UInt    p  len  NULL   frameTime  videoData           END              which finally allows me to access the pure pixelBuffer to be accessed in   my  displayAndCompressFrame  function  In my  displayAndCompressFrame  function I display the pixels on a   custom frame and compress the frame via           START            err   D ICMCompressionSessionEncodeFrame  videoData  compressionSession    pixelBuffer                                  displayTime  displayDuration    validTimeFlags                                  frameOptions  NULL  NULL           END              This triggers my  useCompressedFrame  function           START            static OSStatus useCompressedFrame  void  encodedFrameOutputRefCon                                     ICMCompressionSessionRef session                                     OSStatus err                                     ICMEncodedFrameRef encodedFrame                                     void  reserved       int size   D ICMEncodedFrameGetDataSize  encodedFrame            WHAT NOW        return err             END                  in which I can send the encoded frame across a network but before I   involve any network functionality I first want to test if the   decompression works  However  here is the problem and I will start with   a simple first question      Can I feed the encoded frame to the same decompression session which   decompresses my device data and displays it or do I need to create a   second decompression session with the respective callback   If I need to   create another decompression session are there any special requirements   I need to take care of    so far my first try also failed   Thanks a lot in advance  best     A l e x                      Seth Willits                                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored    QuickTime API mailing list            Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription         net        This email sent to                                                     Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
