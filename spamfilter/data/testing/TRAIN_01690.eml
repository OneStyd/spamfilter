Re  ALSA  almost  made easy  gamix rocks This mixer is specific to ALSA s special stuff  I use it in addition to the other mixers if I need something special   I built it a while ago  may need a   rebuild          Matthias Saou     wrote      Once upon a time  Ville wrote        Ah   The mixer stuff was what made me look for an init script in the    first place  I didn t bother to check whether the existing stuff would    have worked with that   Will try that out  you can assume silence       success       Well  from what I ve tried  both the main and the PCM  at least  volume  levels can be controlled either by  alsamixer  or the good old  aumix           From what I can tell after only   days using it   ALSA rocks        especially      since having a full OSS compatibility results that it breaks nothing at      all            Agreed   Though with only   hours experience       I guess hope some other people from the list will try it out        Both problems you reported  libasound so and wrong xine dependency  are now  fixed in the current packages     Oh  it s maybe also worth pointing out   I ve implemented at last sorting  by both last change date and alphabetically for my  build list  in the php  code        And yes  I accept patches comments suggestions about all those spec files     Matthias                                                       RPM List mailing list         That s  angle  as in geometry                                                     RPM List mailing list
