ALSA  almost  made easyHi all   I ve decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers  As usual the result is that I ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs    but hey  some of you will benefit from that  right       I ve got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system  but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma  Limbo  null  and maybe others  who knows      Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out     Recompile the  alsa driver  source rpm for your running kernel    you can install the binary package if you re using the i                 Install this  alsa driver  package   Install the  alsa libs  package   Install the  alsa utils  package  Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your  etc modules conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading      very complete and very good documentation   Hopefully you ll see that your card  is  supported      Reboot  or remove by hand your current sound modules  you ll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource      by hand  and insert the new ones  If all is well you ve got ALSA working    dmesg  to check is a good idea   you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e g  aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default   With  aplay  you can already test files to see if you hear anything  You can also install the XMMS plugin  seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit    hmmm  but maybe it s another plugin  to listen to your good ol  mp  files    that s it   It really isn t complicated  and has never been from what I see  The only thing I disliked was to have to install from source    but as I can t imagine myself doing that     I ve repackaged everything cleanly  Even the  dev entries are included in the rpm package  and  not  created by an ugly  post script  I insist   and seamlessly integrate into the  etc makedev d structure  There are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided ALSA spec files  for example I ve split alsa lib s development files into an alsa lib devel package and included static libraries    there are others of course  oh yes  the kernel version against which the  alsa driver  package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release  so does the architecture     I m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages   Download      Current spec files          All others  patches etc         Matthias  PS  As an extra bonus  I ve also recompiled xine with alsa support  Simply run  xine  A alsa    and off you go  It may even support     and S PDIF          Clean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages     Red Hat Linux release      Valhalla  running Linux kernel           Load                   AC on line  battery charging                                                              RPM List mailing list
