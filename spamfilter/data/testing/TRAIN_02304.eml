Re  OOwriter always hangs  and then quits unexpectedly when images  are copied  copy paste  from a websiteOn                  PM  Merciadri Luca wrote    Hi      As stated in the title  my OOwriter always hangs and then quits   unexpectedly when I copy at least one image from a website  This   situation happens e g  when I copy some text from wikipedia  and that   there are some images between the different paragraphs   I just opened a new Writer         b  document then selected the   title image    from     and pasted it into the document   No errors  hangs or  quits      Is it normal  It is really annoying  Technically speaking  copying and   pasting such images directly should be avoided  and the images should be   included from an image file  but doing this is not necessary   An example would help                                                                   and should   not be the only way to copy text without making OOwriter bugging  And    sometimes  I do not even want the images  but as the selection in   Iceweasel FF needs to be  continuous   they need to be included in my   selection if I want to take a bunch of text into OOwriter  and then   remove the images from the copied stuff      I selected all of the Early life section  copied it to the clipboard  with Edit  Copy then bounced over to a new Writer document and  pasted it with Edit  Paste   No problems whatsoever       Dissent is patriotic  remember        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
