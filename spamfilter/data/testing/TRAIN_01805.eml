 ILUG  connecting at     bps in RH     help  Hi All   Anyone ever try connecting at     bps in Linux  I ve got a USR   K Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another  same  modem and I have to connect at this speed due to the  NT  port settings on the remote side  but the modem handshake always fails at this speed   The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds      bps to       bps  but that is no good for tx rx ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle     bps   Note Minicom fails to handshake at     bps  but HyperTerm in Windows worked first time      any ideas   Baud        data bits Even Parity  I am doing a ATZ  to reset the modem then I send this init string   AT F E V Q X Y S       A  B  C  D  H  I  K  M  N  P  R  S  U  Y       which is most of the defaults   USR said to set S        disables v         set S       disable v      X    But the S       just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving up   btw this is a bank s system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their modems may be difficult   Colin        Colin Nevin  Software Engineer  Merit Solutions Ltd   Dublin     Goatstown Cross  Dublin                                                Printed using      recycled electrons       Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
