Does QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime block The documentation isn t clear  will QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime     block or just return nil if the data isn t there yet   I m iterating a movie frame by frame from a secondary thread  Rather   than polling spinning on QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable   for each   frame  can I just CopyImageForTime   and let it block until the data is   available  The alternative is to install a hook via   QTVisualContextSetImageAvailableCallback   and trigger a semaphore  but   blocking on the Copy call would be much more straightforward   Thanks   Matt Slot   Bitwise Operator   Ambrosia Software  Inc                                                            Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
