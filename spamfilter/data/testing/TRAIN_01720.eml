Re  Alsa Redhat   compatabilityMatthias Saou     wrote    I really think that with my ALSA packages  ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never  been so easy       I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably   months or more  so I could use my laptop s ESS chip best  hard disk recording and such   Wow  maybe   to    months  time flys  I didn t look forward to doing that tedious build every time I changed a kernel or something  Matthias has made this a thing of the past  Dude  it s a no brainer  use apt get or just download and install   What s more  OSS is fully  imitated   older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam  My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better  alsaplayer  xmms with alsa module  to my ear   The   things that trick people are the modules conf file  they didn t have that automatic matrix page when I started with alsa  you don t know how good you have it   And on my old installs  only the first time I installed it on a clean box   alsa always was  muted  until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music  It s possible Matthias even took care of that too  Anyway it is was only a one time thing on  st install  that was a long time ago for me   Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the     kernel but missed it  but it s been in     for a while now  so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel      That s  angle  as in geometry                                                     RPM List mailing list
