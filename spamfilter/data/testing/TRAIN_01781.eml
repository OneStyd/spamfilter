 Spambayes  timtest broke  Skip Montanaro    After my latest cvs up  timtest fails with         Traceback  most recent call last           File   home skip src spambayes timtest py   line      in             drive nsets          File   home skip src spambayes timtest py   line      in drive           d   Driver           File   home skip src spambayes timtest py   line      in   init             self global ham hist   Hist options nbuckets        AttributeError   OptionsClass  object has no attribute  nbuckets      I m running it as         timtest  n    Data timtest out     from my   Mail directory  not from my   src spambayes directory    If I   create a symlink to   src spambayes bayes ini it works once again  but   shouldn t there be an nbuckets attribute with a default value already   I never used ConfigParser before  but I read that its read   method silently ignores files that don t exist   If  bayes ini  isn t found   none  of the options will be defined   Since you want to run this from a directory other than my spambayes directory  it s up to you to check in changes to make that possible
