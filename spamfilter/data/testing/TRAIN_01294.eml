SMTP Error     while using smarthost for mail deliveryHello alltogether  Currently I am trying to set up a Debian Lenny Server  but I am stuck at mail delivery  The server I am trying to set up  has no FQDN  so I used my ISP Mailserver as a smarthost  I enabled the proper SMTP authentication in exim    This setup worked a few days  before I suddenly received     errors  At first I thought it to be a problem with Exim   so I switched to postfix  But postfix also gives me the     error   Apr             openshoolproxy postfix smtp            CF  EF   to    orig to    relay smtp strato com                     delay       delays                      dsn        status deferred  host smtp strato com                 said      Local Error  in reply to end of DATA command    To further troubleshoot my problem I used telnet to connect to smtp strato com and to send a mail manually   This is what I did   telnet smtp strato de    Trying                   Connected to smtp strato de  Escape character is           smtp passthru EHLO openshoolproxy     smtp passthru     ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES      BITMIME     DELIVERBY     SIZE               AUTH PLAIN LOGIN CRAM MD      HELP AUTH LOGIN     VXNlcm hbWU  d Vic VydmljZUBiMW ubGluZS kZQ       UGFzc dvcmQ  xxxxMYPASSWORD IN BASE  xxxx           OK Authenticated mail from                Sender ok rcpt to                Recipient ok DATA     Start mail input  end with     test       Local Error     Very odd  After this fail I tried the same procedure from my arch linux box at home  It succeeded      telnet smtp strato com    Trying                   Connected to smtp strato com  Escape character is           post strato de  fruni mo   ESMTP RZmta      ready  Thu     Apr                      MEST  EHLO openshoolproxy     post strato de  fruni mo   greets                  ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES      BITMIME     PIPELINING     DELIVERBY     SIZE               AUTH PLAIN LOGIN CRAM MD      STARTTLS     HELP AUTH LOGIN     VXNlcm hbWU  d Vic VydmljZUBiMW ubGluZS kZQ       UGFzc dvcmQ  xxxxMYPASSWORD IN BASE  xxxx           OK Authenticated mail from                Sender ok rcpt to                Recipient ok DATA     Enter data for mail with id g    am MD AJw test mich       queued as g    am MD AJw   This looks very strange to me  Independently from my mailserver the telnet command should have succeeded on both machines  But it failed on my debian box  What could be wrong  Is this a problem of my setup  or is my ISP blocking something   Thanks in advance  Benedikt         To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
