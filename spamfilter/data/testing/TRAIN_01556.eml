Re  How to trick my Debian in thinking that a package is not installedOn Tue  Apr          at         PM         Monique Y  Mudama    was heard to say    For some reason  this just now triggered a memory for me   I think   sometimes when aptitude is making suggestions to resolve conflicts  it   will un hold packages   I wonder if this is how your explicit hold gets   removed     Just so this isn t left hanging  the reason I say this shouldn t happen is that it  used  to happen and I fixed it   There were two ways you could get broken holds  and I fixed one in version              The aptitude dependency resolver will now refuse to adjust held     packages or install forbidden versions unless you manually allow     it to   This behavior can be disabled by setting     Aptitude  ProblemResolver  Allow Break Holds to  false        aptitude will still break holds when packages are being     automatically installed  there is a pending patch against apt that     eliminates this behavior     and the other in      rc         all  aptitude now uses the new hooks in apt to prevent the greedy           resolver from removing packages or breaking holds              Closes                                                                                                         I am not  at present  aware of any other circumstances where aptitude wrongly breaks holds   That said  I don t put packages on hold very often  so I depend on users to send bug reports if they re seeing that behavior     Daniel       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
