Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of Lindenmayer systems  also called  L systems  or  substitution systems    In basic form  a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it  specified by a list of transition search and replace rules  In addition to the standard formulation  two alternative implementations are included  sequential systems  in which at most one rule is applied  and tag systems  in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the string   Despite being implemented entirely in Python  for reasonable rules on a modern machine  the system is capable of running thousands of generations per second  Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal patterns  usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle commands   organic looking patterns that can simulate plants or other living things  or even music    License  GNU General Public License  GPL   URL                                                          LM Solve        Development    by Shlomi Fish      Tuesday  July   th

providing a very flexible and sophisticated Unix logging facility  It is based on the model of arbitrary number of channels  stacked together in a top down data flow tree structure with filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave nodes  Channel trees can be either constructed manually through lower level API functions or all at once with a single API function controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree  For generating log messages  a printf style formatting engine is provided which can be extended through callback functions  The data flow inside the channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are assigned to each individual channel     License  MIT X Consortium License  URL
