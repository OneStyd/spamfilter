Re  Unable to connect to my home wirelessOn Fri    May               Celejar wrote        But I ve long found the  recommends  concept to be somewhat tricky and   perhaps to vary from maintainer to maintainer   For example  mesa utils   needs GLX  which  practically speaking  means that you need   libgl  mesa dri   The maintainer refuses to make this even a   recommends  basically since the X server can run on a different machine                  Now  I d bet  although I suppose that I may be wrong  that the vast   majority of Debian installations have the X server and clients on the   same machine  and the other case is probably the more  unusual  one   Imagine a large organization with a lot of thin clients       OTOH  acpi support  recommends  radeontool  even though this package is   utterly irrelevant to those without ATI Radeon chipsets            Oh  I can finally get rid of that one   used to be a Depends and I    forgot to check   Both are excelent examples    But even if you disagree with the    maintainer  in the end Debian is a do ocracy   That is  the one who does    the job usually gets to decide how it s done     Regards  Andrei       Offtopic discussions among Debian users and developers          BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iQEcBAEBCAAGBQJL tsUAAoJEHNWs jeoi p eAH   jXLBi ZRQRNxnYzB exuZ pG pAFPh JtrJTrCALFJ   mbH xOoYy VrABMvCmzPp xoMgz QvhC dmYVdpxz IZsbjfiAj qqGtyQRnsAGOkdJupci IAU wgEqhSOVB zObnxrbbV oFVortP  r LwwFnwIQobtk xAHmpatbEpn JCHhTN MCTLLxXD yacSTTkVH OL  SUUXMUwlU  ZHLnV T sQmMovQtqtM jCvbimhq nJEoYsyiuV  HwhmGjh Gt LRBtvLW gXW iO jq w sUytP  BROvoOHQav E Z y  KgKmU  OeTtJKCq  BLtLT FSwtnD    MKz       END PGP SIGNATURE
