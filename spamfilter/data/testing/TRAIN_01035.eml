Re  backing up LVM volumesOn Tuesday    April               Celejar wrote    I ve had to give up lvm snapshots totally as   broken  primarily because of this  see my messages in the thread             That is troublesome  probably to the point of actually being broken   It s      likely that something  behind the scenes  in LVM is actually messing with t  he    snapshot device even when it is not mounted and preventing the removal   I m fairly sure the snapshot device has to be updated whenever a write is d  one    to a new LE in the original device  and it s possible  that  is causing the      problem   I hope this issue gets some attention  I doubt it is a Debian ism     I ve also been hit by this  although it  may  be harmless  or not     this stuff could really use decent documentation             My guess on this one is one of two things     Udev is taking a little while to unlink  secondary  names for the LVs th  at    are being removed  and when lvm does its device scan it s hitting  missing       devices     LVM is using device names from its cache for devices that are no longer      present for its device scan and  again  hitting  missing  devices   In either case I think the error messages are annoying  but not indicative   of    a real problem    D     Boyd Stephen Smith Jr                 D         D                     o o      ICQ         YM AIM  DaTwinkDaddy                                        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvXWdkACgkQdNbfk   fC IeQCePFEisGlen aQz  t Sa mSIV vOYAn O  lk  MEfY z G xseZbK W u  PDv       END PGP SIGNATURE
