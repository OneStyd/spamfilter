Do you have to deal with Windows on a daily basis  Might as well  maximize your time with it  You ll find that some of these tips  will apply to other operating systems  too  The world of computing  isn t so mysterious once you understand how it works  With this  GnomeTome  you ll begin to work faster   and smarter              I did a lot this weekend  but I didn t really get much done   ya know  My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of  the basement for storage up in the attic  but the pile only  made it as far as the kitchen  Then I stripped and painted  the floor where that collection of stuff was previously  stored  and erected some shelving so I d have room for more  stuff  I woke up the next morning discover a very sick  ferret  likely from the fumes that leeched into the next  room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the  migration of bad air  So  I ended up dismantling the ferret  cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I m sure  it s safe  Thankfully  all critters are doing well now    I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws  with stainless steel deck screws out back  but found that  the ones I picked up are too weak  leaving me with stripped  out heads and bent shafts  That project stopped after barely  getting started  The front steps are also in need of rust  proof screws  but they are made from much softer wood  so I  moved the tools to the other side of the house  Two thirds  of the way through the first row  I found that the extra       on the screws I purchased was too much and I began  running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath   Figures  Live and learn     Oh well  it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway   Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead   Roughly an hour into geekitude  I glanced over and realized  it was      degrees in the basement and I was virtually  stuck to my chair from the sweat  I shut off as much as I  really could and still work on a couple of projects  but it  didn t help the heat situation much  It was just too hot  outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added  heat from the computers  That left me in need of a shower  and with only the notebook in the living room for the  balance of the weekend  I cleaned out a lot of ancient  email  which was nice  but nothing really got accomplished  otherwise  Boy  am I tired  And the weekend is so far away    Hey  the second season of M A S H comes out on DVD  tomorrow  That should put me in better spirits  I could  watch M A S H for hours on end  In fact  I often do just  that  The only kink is that the episodes don t play back to back  from DVD  I m going to play with AppleScript on the Mac  to see if I can customize how the individual discs play  In  theory  I should be able to make a disc play all the way  through  If I succeed  I ll be sure to share the script  technique in the    Too bad I can t do that with a stand alone DVD player    See You in  Randy Nieland

hotfix and a workaround  so take your pick as to which will  work best  I often map drive letters to specific network  shares  and if I happen to have a system turned off  I ll  notice a significant delay when clicking the drop down boxes  in Open  Look In or Save In As dialog boxes  Windows       attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you  the list  and depending on how many drives you have mapped  and how many of those resources are unavailable  it can take  eons just to save a file  A workaround is to use the My  Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive  letters  Fine for some  but I prefer having drive letters  mapped for many things  being that I work at a command  prompt quite a bit  and it s easier to navigate that way   Alternatively  a hotfix is now available  but you ll have to  contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that s the route you  choose            nbsp GnomeSYSTEM        Customized  x ME Blue Screen Errors     We ve all seen  em  Those annoyingly incoherent blue  screens indicating a system error of some sort  but provide  no real help in solving the problem  If you re a programmer  that has had to deal with error conditions produced by  Windows       ME  then this might be a better way to handle  them within your applications  Blue Screen v     is an  ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error  functions  but provides a way to pass along text and  response options you designate  Note that this is not  functional on Windows NT      XP  which handle system errors  in an entirely different manner      Gamers Beware of Intel    G Chipset      Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when  reading up on all of this  but one thing is painfully clear   The Intel    G chipset and P  Celeron processors really  don t provide an acceptable gaming experience  Not only is  performance subject to ridicule  but compatibility is also  looking to be a serious matter  Intel has never claimed that  Celerons were high end desktop processors  but they have  typically provided a decent enough experience that they can  make for acceptable machines for the more budget minded  consumer  The compatibility issues with this particular  version of Celeron and the    G chipset are something to  watch out for  Once the Celeron is moved to the     micron  core  I suspect the performance concern won t remain  but  the    G alone seems to have it s own problems without  adding the Celeron misery  The lesson in knowing what  hardware you re buying is what s important here             nbsp

your computer  All you have to do  is double click on a Desktop icon called  Uninstall Programs   quickly find  the program you want to uninstall and click a button  Add Remove Plus         unlike the standard Windows uninstall feature  the Control Panel Add Remove  Programs applet   will uninstall the program and remove it from the list                          nbsp GnomeASSISTANT        Test Drive Compaq Servers     Compaq  Ok  HP  offers a set of servers running various   nix operating systems  as well as Oracle  i  for test  drive  Just register for an account and you can tinker  around with Linux  FreeBSD or even Tru   Unix running on an  Alpha server  but without the hassle and expense of  obtaining your own toys  I love the idea of having a pre  configured environment that lets you kick the tires without  causing any permanent damage             nbsp GnomeSTUFF        Too Cool     This was just too interesting not to mention  Water cooled  systems are all the rage among overclockers and those  that seem to need bragging rights over their friends  computer  systems  Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and  applying the concept where it s truly needed   notebook  computers  Believe me when I say that these suckers get very  hot  I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap  and  I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my  own little heat stroke  Fans and the mini water cooling  system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat  mitigation efficiency  but without the noise  The concept of  a water cooled notebook sounds a little odd  but I would  welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open  arms                           Your subscribed e mail address is        To unsubscribe or change your delivery
