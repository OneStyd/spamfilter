Re  non ASCII environmentOn Fri  Apr         at        Jerome BENOIT   wrote    Hello List      I am writing some C code which involves ASCII characters    in C related books  we can find a lot of comments about   ASCII character issues  as far as we are concern with portability      Nevertheless  something bothers me  where non ASCII environment can be found         Furthermore  can such an environment be created on a Debian box     The aim is to check the portability of my code   Well  Unicode  specifically the UTF   encoding  is generally the standard for modern Linux systems  Of course  as long as you are using only characters that are in ASCII  UTF   is compatible    There is also GB        China s Unicode encoding  but again  it is ASCII compatible   The Win     NET and Java platforms all use UTF    USC    it s complicated  natively  which is not ASCII and is not ASCII compatible   Joel s Unicode article is from       but still very useful     Some good essays from Tim Bray            Cheers  Kelly Clowers       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
