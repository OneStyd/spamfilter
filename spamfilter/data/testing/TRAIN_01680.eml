Re  partitioning a new hard diskOn                  PM  roberto wrote    hello    a friend gave me a laptop  sony vaio  where i want to install debian   squeeze  in dual boot     actually the disk is partitioned as follows  output from mount   command    s are my comments         total       GB       free  extended partition  ntfs    dev sda  on  media VAIO type fuseblk    rw nosuid nodev allow other default permissions blksize             total       GB        free  primary partition  ntfs    dev sda  on  media VAIO  type fuseblk    rw nosuid nodev allow other default permissions blksize             how would you repartitionate the disk  since i have to leave a certain   amount of space for Xp for other users     i thought about installing debian next to the VAIO  partition and then   use the other partition VAIO for read and write    Which is the  real  XP partition  sda  or sda    If nothing s on sda   then that should be more than enough for a  laptop install       Dissent is patriotic  remember        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
