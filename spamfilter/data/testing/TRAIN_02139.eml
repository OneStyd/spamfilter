Re   ILUG  Mutt reply hooksHi   havn t tried this  but looks like what you want   I use procmail to filter different incomgin To CCs to different folders then use folder hok  but this looks closer to what you want                                                                                  Some of the mailto links on our web site forward to me  When I reply to someone who writes to one of these aliases  I prefer to keep the mail alias as the From  address in my reply  For example  when someone sends email to   to suggest a program for me to review  pardon the blatant plug      it forwards to me  When I hit reply  the From  line in the email will contain   instead of my main address    My  muttrc file accomplishes this with two lines   set alternates         set reverse name                                                                              On Tue     Jul       David Neary wrote     I have   or   email addresses  which get used for different   reasons   and I d prefer not to mix them up  So I was wondering   if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail  apart from list   mail  which I have already sorted  which arrives to a certain   e mail address have the From  header in the reply automatically   set to the address it came to       For example  say I have a company  and        and   arrive in the same mailbox    I don t want to reply to   mails with the From    set to    I would like the mail to come from           Is there any way to do this  Bearing in mind that mail can arrive   with my email in the To or Cc fields  and Bcc    and it might be   buried in a couple of dozen other recipients          Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
