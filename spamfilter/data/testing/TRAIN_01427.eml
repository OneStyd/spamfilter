Kaffeine is a mere shadow of itselfHi   I recently upgraded most of my KDE programs to the KDE   versions  and for one program I regretted it after only a few minutes   Here is a list of the regressions in kaffeine I noticed so far     cannot save tracks from an audio CD as  ogg files anymore    does not display tracks when playing an audio CD  screen is black    stops playing audio CD after first track    window size is fixed  videos are resized to fit window size rather   than the other way around    the settings menu is almost empty  nothing to configure anymore   apparently    does not have a manual  I m not going to look any further but will rather go back to       and put it on hold   It feels like using an application that is maybe at version      rather than a     release candidate   Given that kaffeine     was a quite mature program with lots of features  I find this very sad   Regards          Sven       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
