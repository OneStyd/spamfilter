Re     bit netbooks with Debian linuxMark Allums put forth on                PM    On                PM  Stan Hoeppner wrote     Mark Allums put forth on               PM         With    bits  you will need more memory  so I suggest you look for a     machine that can use   GB of memory        A user s application usage patterns dictate how much memory the machine    needs  not the width of the CPU registers   The comment above belongs    in the    winders user world  not here on the debian user list  where we are    assumed    to be competent OPs   The reasoning behind your suggestion is totally    flawed       No     bit binaries are larger   This indicates to me that more memory   is very useful to have   If wallets were all unlimited  we d all have all our DIMM slots maxed   I made the same argument as you quite some time ago in favor of   bit Linux for small systems such as netbooks   I was shot down and educated on the actual memory footprint of the x      binaries  and it turns out they re not that much larger overall  and not nearly to the size that one should need  GB RAM on a netbook   Most of them come with  GB anyway  which should be more than enough for just about all application mixes  whether one chooses a   bit OS apps or   bit     I admit I am just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous  rather than an   expert  but on this subject I am confident I am correct   Correct in that one should get  GB on a netbook due to   bit binary size  Or correct that   bit binaries are  slightly  larger than   bit binaries  I d agree with you on the latter but not on the former   Stating the case of the former is spreading misinformation   I attempted to shoot it down   It is simply not correct to recommend  GB for the reason you stated     Please do not try to insult   It is not really useful  and wastes time   Apologies   It wasn t meant as an insult but as an exclamation point backing incredulity       Stan       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
