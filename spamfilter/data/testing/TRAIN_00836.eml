Re  storage bitsAt Fermi  yes I m back there  long story   we re buying  U systems like  the fiscal year is ending   We have     ASA IR US  systems  not pushing  them  there are some other similar units available   with    more on  order   They re       TB for    K  although we add a separate IDE or  SCSI system disk  because the  Ware RAID controllers can saturate   Intel SDS  motherboard       GHz P s    GB ram     Ware      Raid  controllers        GB Maxtors  SysKonnect gigabit enet  Fermi RedHat          There s some interesting info at      We ve decided to go with XFS  which Linus has just merged into the      tree   mostly because none of the other journaled fs s can maintain      GB s rates with a nearly full filesystem  mostly GB files  with random  deletions  we use these systems for caching our   petabyte tape store      Ext  almost did it but dropped from from    MB s to    with random  deletions  and didn t want to do direct io at all   Only concern is an  occasional system lock up we haven t chased down yet   A load avg        is always a patio of fun   Oddly  even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up  with the new STK     B tape drives  which crank along at a steady    GB s   And you oldforktimers will remember  doofus  my old file server  system   It would only take      of rackspace now  instead of    racks   Cheers  Wayne
