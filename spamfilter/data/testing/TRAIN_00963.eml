RE  when building a rpm i    redhat linux  is appended to man page         Original Message        From  Matthias Saou  mailto      Sent  Monday  August               PM   To      Subject  Re  when building a rpm i    redhat linux  is appended to man   page         Once upon a time  Harig  wrote                   The workaround is to pass an extra argument to configure    as follows                 configure   program prefix     program prefix    program prefix                   This works when you are defining a switch that  configure     does not already define  but how can we override an     existing switch       Well   configure doesn t define    program prefix    so that s why it   works  Maybe you thought that was an example  but no  it s    the exact syntax   to use as a workaround          Matthias     Actually  I was hoping that you could answer the question  how can we  override an existing switch    For example   configure uses the command  line switch    prefix    How can we override that value      configure                                                           RPM List mailing list
