RE  Compositing two movies I need to play two movies in sync  compositing them in a custom way    One approach I came up with is to put the movies in QTMovieLayers  Core   Animation   and then I can use a Core Image filter for the compositing      Does that sound reasonable  or is there another approach that is   likely to perform significantly better   Depending on how much custom the compositing you need is  I guess you could create a movie referring to content in those two and maybe use some tweening code too if needed                          George Birbilis     Microsoft MVP J            Borland Spirit of Delphi                                  Insert QuickTime in PowerPoint  Forms etc                                                       Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  QuickTime API mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
