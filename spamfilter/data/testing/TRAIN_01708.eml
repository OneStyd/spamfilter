Re  Questions about RAID  On Monday    April               Tim Clewlow wrote    I m getting ready to build a RAID   with   x  TB drives to start    but the intention is to add more drives as storage requirements   increase   Since you seem fine with RAID    I ll assume you are also fine with RAID     I don t know what your requirements   levels of paranoia are  but RAID   is      probably better than RAID   until you are up to   or   drives  the chance o  f a    double failure in a    or less  drive array is minuscule     I intend to use mdadm to build   run the array   Modern mdadm can migrate from RAID   to RAID   when you add the  th  th dri  ve    into the array   Also modem mdadm has a wealth of RAID     features that may actually be a    better performance wise than RAID   or RAID       If an unrecoverable   read error  bad block that on disk circuitry cant resolve  is   discovered on a disk then how does mdadm handle this  It appears the   possibilities are       the disk gets marked as failed in the array   ext  does not get   notified of a bad block  This one     I would really like to hear it is either   or   as I would prefer   not to have an entire disk immediately marked bad due to one   unrecoverable read error  Sorry     I would prefer to be notified instead so   I can still have RAID   protecting  most  of the data until the disk   gets replaced   You can add the failed device back into the array and it will re sync until      there is another issue with the device   Just be sure to remember which dev  ice    needs replacing for when your new HW arrives    D     Boyd Stephen Smith Jr                 D         D                     o o      ICQ         YM AIM  DaTwinkDaddy                                        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvWCUAACgkQdNbfk   fC HYACfRHIIKegtr  i C Wr REXM L leEAnRCaSLzxcbjtJPRmIAWeqwuTWg Y  G oK      END PGP SIGNATURE
