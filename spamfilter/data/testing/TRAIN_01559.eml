Re  Deleting some regexp simple expression from lots of files in a secure wayOn Friday    May               Merciadri Luca wrote     Boyd Stephen Smith Jr     writes      On Friday    May               Merciadri Luca wrote       I have many text files  actually  tex files  which contain some      sequence or regexp  it depends on the files  that I would like to      remove  Is there a commandline GUI for doing this massive edit           sed  i  e  s  regexp      file   for a single file    GNU sed only            find  dir  type f  exec sed  i  e  s  regexp           for all files in     a directory         I am using the second command  The problem is that  for one set of   files  that I have selected  no problem for this   I have to use a   really simple expression  I need to find all the occurences of     paragraph    and replace them with nothing  i e  with      I know   regexps  but replacing   regexp  with   paragraph    gives error   messages  Any idea  Thanks      irst you need a  basic  regular expression  BRE  that matches   paragrap  h         The     is a BRE special character  so it needs to be escaped   Also  the           is a bit troublesome with find  exec  so we will match it using the constru  ct               The definitive documentation for regular expression is the Single UNIX    Specification  Version      Base Definitions  Chapter     I don t actually      like  man   regex  for this   This gives us the regex    paragraph          Now  we need to get that regu  lar    expression to sed    find  dir  type f  exec sed  i  e  s   paragraph                      won t work  since during Quote Removal  one of the    s are dropped   and    neither find nor sed  sees  it   The shell does a  lot  of processing to the text you type before it reaches      the command you are invoking   Single UNIX Specification  Version      Shel  l    and Utilities  Chapter   is the core documentation  but some shells are muc  h    more featureful   We can either use  find  dir  type f  exec sed  i  e  s   paragraph                      OR  my preference   regex  D   paragraph         find  dir  type f    exec    sed  i  e  s  regex           to make sure sed gets that important       Also  I left it out  but you may want the  g  flag to the  s ubstitute comm  and    in sed   Otherwise  only one occurrence of the regex will get eliminated pe  r    line    D     Boyd Stephen Smith Jr                 D         D                     o o      ICQ         YM AIM  DaTwinkDaddy                                        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvtoYEACgkQdNbfk   fC  vACeKBfWOolvbKlcdh MwW b  mG GMUAn  J  Awm ds MBWnOzKMWJ RQfn  qy        END PGP SIGNATURE
