Re  Snow Leopard refresh problemsYes  I fixed those issue with some silly workarounds only  The repaint  methods are not producing any fruitful results   These are the options I used     In some cases  resizing the frame solved the issue     In few cases  changed the location of one of the component present inside  the frame and then relocating the same component to its original position at  the end of the method solved the problem     In one case  removed the component and added the same component to the  frame solved the issue   Another typical point to note is  I could not find a single common solution  for all the above   cases   Regards  VPKVL        Original Message        From   hoverfrog    To   Vijay Kachhawal    Sent  Friday  May                PM Subject  Re  Snow Leopard refresh problems   hello   did you find any workarounds  Are some methods of asking for a repaint more reliable than others   regards   Mary  Le    May               AM  Vijay Kachhawal a  crit      I have also experienced similar problem in many cases  My project  is    based on purely swing and graphics API  Everything works fine  and no    repaint issues when I am running the app on Mac            but found    several repaint issues when executed the same application  on Snow    Leaopard      Regards    VPKVL         Original Message         From  Bino George   To  hoverfrog   Cc      Sent  Friday  May                AM   Subject  Re  Snow Leopard refresh problems     Hi            Is your App publicly accessible   Please file a bug at      with the URL for the App and steps  to    reproduce it etc  If it is not accessible    please create a standalone test case that can reproduce the problem  and    attach it to the bug  Also  please include your configuration   which java    update etc       Thanks    Bino George    Java Runtime Engineer    Apple Inc         On May           at      PM  hoverfrog wrote       various components in our app refresh by calling paintComponent        updateUI    paintImmediately    etc     On SL we re seeing a range of refresh errors   basically the  components     are not being redrawn     Usually  if you change the content pane of a JFrame it repaints    it s     not happening  even when explicitly asked for     Has anyone else seen anything like this        Oh  Tiger works like a dream  as does Windoze and Linux                                                                              Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored     Java dev mailing list             Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription             This email sent to                                                             Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored    Java dev mailing list            Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription           valuelabs net     This email sent to vijay                                                             Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
