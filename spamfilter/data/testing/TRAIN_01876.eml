AOL mailbox when he s out  of the office  and I figure it s going to be a piece of  cake  He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along  with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox  which was  the driving force behind this request  What I found was that  Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding  rule  but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent  out to the Internet upon receipt  even though it appeared to  be included in the rule  As it happens  this is due to a  default configuration option on the Exchange     server that  prevents automatic replies forwards from being sent to the  Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service  A quick  configuration change and restart of IMS will put things  right            nbsp GnomeSYSTEM        Stop the

  nbsp GnomeASSISTANT        Windows XP System File Checker    Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a  possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under  Windows XP  and I did indeed run through it prior to  attempting an in place upgrade  obviously with no  improvement  It s still worth a mention  however  in case  you re not familiar with what it s there for  As you re  probably aware  XP contains a file protection scheme that  will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or  altered in any way  ensuring that XP is kept in a stable  state  Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack   and the SFC is meant to restore order  Note that any  hotfixes and other Microsoft provided updates will be left  in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is  used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has  been messed with  To access the SFC  simply launch a command  prompt and type  SFC  to display a list of options            nbsp GnomeSTUFF        Consider This   Forwarded by JW    The next time you have a face to face with your elected  representatives  you might want to start asking about their  opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and  right  Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain  death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz  Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman  If Mr  Berman  gets his way  companies may very well be allowed to hack  into your systems without proof of provocation in order to  ensure that you are using their software according to the  stated rules  Mind you  if they cause colateral damage or  upset other systems  there isn t thing one you can do in  return  Nope  they ll have legal protection  This garbage is  seriously getting scary  If you think it won t be abused   consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly  pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe s software  and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the  authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act  He was  eventually released  but that doesn t make it any more  right                           Your subscribed e mail address
