Postfix  SASL and LDAPDBHey guys   I want to set up SASL authentication using LDAPDB  but it seems that postfix connects to LDAP but doesn t send anything to it     I try to authenticate using  auth plain     and I receive              Error  authentication failed  authentication failure  Connection to LDAP works fine at the network level  but the only thing that postfix send to Slapd  sniffed using tcpdump  is a  UNBIND  request  Confirmed by the logs of slapd        May             samchiel slapd        conn    fd    ACCEPT from IP                  IP                May             samchiel slapd        conn    op   UNBIND May             samchiel slapd        conn    fd    closed       Postfix says the following        May             samchiel postfix smtpd           localhost                       Error  authentication failed  authentication failure       So  I assumed there might be something wrong with my configuration  Since I m on Debian Squeeze  for testing purpose   I have a  etc postfix sasl smtpd conf that contains the configuration of ldapdb          cat  etc postfix sasl smtpd conf pwcheck method  auxprop auxprop plugin  ldapdb mech list  PLAIN LOGIN ldapdb uri    ldapdb id  postfix ldapdb pw  ZZZZzzzzZZZZZZZ ldapdb mech  DIGEST MD  PLAIN LOGIN       and sasl directives in main conf         grep smtpd sasl main cf smtpd sasl type   cyrus smtpd sasl auth enable   yes smtpd sasl path   smtpd smtpd sasl security options   noanonymous smtpd sasl local domain    mydomain smtpd sasl authenticated header   yes        Did I miss anything   Any clue on why postfix doesn t send anything but an UNBIND request to LDAP      Thanks  Julien       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
