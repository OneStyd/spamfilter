zero brightness post Snow Leopard upgradeOn my white MacBook       eta  that I recently upgraded from Leopard   to Snow Leopard  I have installed all current updates   Now  and not before  I notice that frequently when I start to re use   the machine that it has zero brightness when it powers up  The    increase brightness  control has no effect  but other keys do work     If I close the lid but then reopen it before the machine goes to sleep   that usually does the trick and I have medium ish  brightness and can   turn brightness up or down   I am testing if this is related to X   Xquartz so thought I would ask   here if anybody else has experience this problem   I can provide more h w details later   Thanks  M   Dr  Michael K Bane Senior Development Officer RESEARCH COMPUTING SERVICES Devonshire House Precinct Centre The University of Manchester Manchester M    PL                                                          Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  X   users mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
