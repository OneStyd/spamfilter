Re  KDE       in unstableHello   On ketvirtadienis    Gegu C  BE C                   Boyd Stephen Smith Jr    wrote      Debian packagers don t have that much time to spend on packaging  they     are volunteers after all   and hardly they can do decisions about which     particular branch is better      They have to package the last one which has             been released  unless has been released very soon and there is no time      for testing         Stable is going to be with those users for at least a year  probably more    They deserve more than whatever upstream wants to throw at the wall this   week   Debian users deserve quality packaging of upstream software  good integrati  on    of it throughout the whole distribution and general assumption that it won   t    eat their kittens  yet data loss bugs happen   But whether upstream softwar  e    meets users  needs is out of Debian scope  Just find another software solut  ion    which does  develop it by yourself  pay somebody to develop it for you or a  sk    kindly and wait till somebody else is motivated enough to do it        Also  is specially hard to decide which branch is better  because      branch A can have application X in a great shape  and application Y in   a      bad one  while in branch B the case might be the opposite  And having   to      go back one whole release of the whole software compilation just becau  se      one app has one annoying dependency is a little bit overkill  isn t it         Just block the KDEPIM     apps from migrating to testing   The KDEPIM       programs already work with the KDEBASE     libraries         Heck  just stop  kmail  from migrating   Korganizer and KAddressBook have   required Akonadi since     or earlier   Move on  kdepim     is gone  Given that KDE SC     might release with kdepi  m    from     anyway extending kdepim     codebase lifetime to   year  beating d  ead    horse       makes absolutely no sense  I recommend you to face reality here     These responses are quite frustrating   I read Ana s post as  please make   sure KDE     is ready for stable    My post was  KDE     is inappropriate   for stable    All the replies have been  too bad  we are going to release   it anyway    Don t you see that you always put yourself in the front in your rationales       YOU run a dozen of DB servers  YOU don t want another one  YOU don t trust      MySQL  YOU say KDE     is inappropriate for stable  Nothing objective and Y  OU    assume that your truth is an ultimate one  Pet bugs are always RC to the    reporter  but yet again  we need to face reality here  If YOU have so many      problems with particular piece of software  look for better options or read      the first part of this mail again     D     Modestas Vainius         BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvjGZQACgkQHO JRnPq hQwNQCeOstFKXUdBC S  fOojhi ENE UKIAoMvweBx Je  mU  zfP Q M IKEp  i po      END PGP SIGNATURE
