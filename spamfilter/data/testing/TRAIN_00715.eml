Re  MotherboardsOn                  PM  Jean Fran ois wrote    Hello      I might be wrong  but I guess the exact name for your motherboard is    DFI Lanparty DK p   t rs PLUS  as opposed to the Elite or Turbo    models   which has   SATAII ports  and I also guess you have used the    two yellow ports  If so  plug your drives in the orange ports to use    the Sata controller from the ICH  R and not the JMicron JMB     given    the vast amount of options traditionnally present in a DFI LanParty    BIOS  you can probably disable the JMicron controller if you want to    do so       The ICH  R only provides   SATAII ports  and the JMicron controller is    there to provide   additionnal ports     Yes  the PLUS is the correct model  I will have to look into it again   but I have   drives so they could not all be in the two yellow ports   This may also explain why fdisk lists my drives in the order  sdc  sdb   sda  Running lspci  k  I don t recall seeing ata piix at all   Thanks for the input  I will have another look tonight        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
