Debian style task packages for RH    availableHi   This has been hashed over a few times on various lists  now I finally got  around to doing something about it    You can now add  rpm   redhat     task  to your sources list  and after apt get update you can find out what s available with   apt cache search  task    These are generated directly from comps xml of RH    so they contain  exactly the same packages as you ll get by choosing the various categories  at install time  I didn t bother including SRPMS for these as they are  rather uninteresting  if you want you can re generate the  specs by  running    BTW the repository only contains the task packages  you ll need an  apt enabled mirror of RH    in your sources list to actually do anything  with it          Panu                                                        RPM List mailing list
