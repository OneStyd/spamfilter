How does the Finder decide that two drives are on the same  partition When I make two  local  disks via MacFuse and I try to eject one of them   the Finder insists on warning me that there are two drives on the same   partition  and giving me the option to unmount all of them or just the   one I tried to  This is very inconvenient for me   The mount command shows      on  Volumes MyFS  Gig         on  Volumes MyFS  Gig        My suspicion is that the Finder just looks for the mount   rom value   then calls volumes partitions on the same disk if they only vary in the   last number   Thoughts   Thanks  Jim O Connor                                                   Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Filesystem dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
