Re  Kde        On Thu  May          at         AM        Jorge Gon alves wrote    Hello       First  thank you for the great distro that is Debian  one of the best       I would like to suggest you some way so that the users keep on using   the good old KDE     when they migrate to the upcoming Lenny       Maybe use dummy packages  or rename the packages so that KDE     could   remain installed  and not be forced to upgrade to Kde      No  there is not sane way and there is nobody interested on it     I really feel sorry that KDE   series is no more being developed  and   when the day cames that I no longer will be able to use KDE    I will   switch to Apple or even Windows  but NEVER to kde  or Gnome     and I feel many users out there think like me        You still have gnustep  xfce  lxde  no using any or simply never upgrade   Ana       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
