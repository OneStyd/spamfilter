Re  Why are there no latest books written for Debian systems On Mon     Apr                      EDT   martin f krafft wrote       Stephen Powell wrote     This is hardly a new book   In fact  it was written in the days of Woody      Woody    Sarge    Etch    Lenny    Squeeze       It was written in the days of the sarge freeze and is entirely   focused on sarge        And parts of it are obsolete   But the author focuses on the core    stuff of Unix Linux  and so most of it is still current  It s an    excellent guide for how to accomplish common computing tasks in    Linux       Interesting analysis            I  wanted  to focus on Debian and leave out the  core stuff of   Unix Linux  and  common computing tasks   because that s documented   elsewhere       It is true that in the last   years  some parts have been obsoleted    but I d say most of it still applies       Regardless  there s a need for a new edition  I am working on it   I think there may be some confusion here  Mr  Krafft   The comments I made above were not in reference to anything  you  wrote   They were in reference to the original edition of  The Linux Cookbook   by Michael Stutz  which was copyrighted in              I suggest that you go back and look more closely at my original post                        Stephen Powell                                  To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
