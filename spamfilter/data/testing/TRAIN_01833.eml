Re  Filesystem recommendationsRon Johnson put forth on                PM    On                  PM  B  Alexander wrote      Does anyone have suggestions and practical experience with the pros and    cons of the various filesystems          XFS is the canonical fs for when you have lots of Big Files   I ve also   seen simple benchmarks on this list showing that it s faster than   ext  ext    I ve been very happy with XFS for all file sizes and counts  but my server isn t heavy duty by any means   It handles multiple      MB mbox files with ease as well as serving Samaba shares containing       files per dir   Given that the large mbox files become fairly fragmented over time due to constant appends  having an online file defragmenter  xfs fsr  is very handy   The myth that certain filesystems don t fragment files and thus don t need a defrag tool are just that  myths   I ve run with mbox on both EXT  and XFS  and the larger mbox files always fragment over time regardless of filesystem   Prior to my last xfs fsr run  I had    mbox files  a single user  that ranged from       fragments each   Those in the       fragment range were      MB files   I don t have empirical data to show how much this negatively affected performance  but my mail client did seem a bit snappier after defragging     nilfs   btrfs and exofs are  definitely  still beta or even alpha   I ve not played with any of these myself  but what I m seeing on the various mailing lists suggests what Ron states here     xfs and ext     can all be extended   For production servers with a   working UPS  I d go with ext  for      boot and xfs  since it hates   sudden power outages  for the   data  directories   For production   workstations  I d stick with the standby ext  for      boot and ext  or   xfs for  home and   data   depending on the workload    For production servers I d go with XFS everywhere as long as your kernel  and rescue disk kernel  has XFS built in   Reliable power  via UPS and or generator  is part of the definition of  production  server  so there s no reason to shy away from XFS for any partitions or logical volumes due to power loss fears   Some recent FS benchy comparisons with        rc  on a big RAID setup      As always  no single fs wins across the board   XFS falls flat on its face in the synthetic mail server test  but does very well in all others   Given its results in the mail test are almost identical to EXT   and that EXT  no barrier increases performance   fold  I d say some tweaking of XFS would bring its performance back in line with the others       Stan       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
