RE  The absurdities of life They are legally required to do that   I got a similar check because an insurance company didn t pay a claim quickly enough   It might have been        Although they spent lots more than      to mail you the check  the alternative seems to be to keep the money   Do you really want companies to have a financial incentive to over bill you  just a bit  so they could keep it   For a company with millions of customers       customer starts adding up          From     mailto    On Behalf Of        So I get a check from Pac Bell today  SBC as they re called now     Turns out  they went to the trouble of printing out  signing  sealing   and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole             They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together    Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap   I mean  isn t there   a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness   I don t think I missed   the      but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu   of being returned pennies       I m truly stuck on this though   I don t know whether to frame the   check  burn it  or cash it in   Maybe I should find a way to return to   sender  so they have to spend  more  money on giving me my     dues          Does     even buy anything anymore   Funny bit of it  is I couldn t   even make a phone call these days        boggled    BB            Best regards     bitbitch                          mailto
