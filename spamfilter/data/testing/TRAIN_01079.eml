 ILUG  Mutt reply hooks Hi all   I have   or   email addresses  which get used for different reasons   and I d prefer not to mix them up  So I was wondering if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail  apart from list mail  which I have already sorted  which arrives to a certain e mail address have the From  header in the reply automatically set to the address it came to   For example  say I have a company  and      and   arrive in the same mailbox  I don t want to reply to   mails with the From  set to    I would like the mail to come from     Is there any way to do this  Bearing in mind that mail can arrive with my email in the To or Cc fields  and Bcc    and it might be buried in a couple of dozen other recipients     Cheers  Dave              David Neary      Marseille  France   E Mail         Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
