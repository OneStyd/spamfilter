Re  How to manage multiple Internet connections On Sat    May               Merciadri Luca wrote          But will probably not work in you case  as it was meant to combine two           or more   network ports from the same computer connected to the same          switch             The description says          D  D   The Linux bonding driver provides a method for aggregating   multiple network interfaces into a single logical   bonded     D  D        Strictly speaking  this is what I want  Now  your interpretation seems   to be based on the definition of a link aggregation  which I am not   really familiar with  Basically  I want to merge connections into one    or at least divide and use them separately  in an easy way  This is not   a so rare situation  is it  E g  you might be wandering in some zone   where you can use the WiFi  but where it is sometimes unavailable  say   at specific regions  If you manage to use another connection  for   example the one that is given by your mobile phone smartphone  via    Bluetooth  which is then connected to the internet through other   protocols   it should be possible to switch between these two   connections  or to use them simultaneously  if  say  WiFi  s range is   too small or WiFi s bandwidth too small compared to the smartphone s   one   Okay  this is not a really realistic example          You might also share an internet connection with your neighbour    legally  and use it a lot when he does not need it  Then  if you already   use ethernet  you can use both connections  But how   Bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low level  it is    layer     unless you have two links from the same provider  using some    technology that can be bonded  like ADSL    AFAIU what you need is BGP     but I can t give you any tips as this is    way out of my league     Probably a good start  whatever technology you end up using  is a    GNU Linux  preferably Debian  machine connected to both internet links    and your internal network since consumer gateways don t even have more    than one WAN port                some of them could be used for this with custom firmware  but this    is off topic  Regards  Andrei P S  There is no need to CC me as I am subscribed to the list          Offtopic discussions among Debian users and developers          BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iQEcBAEBCAAGBQJL ribAAoJEHNWs jeoi pVSwIAJ  FpfLJZnjsUNWnPFug ae WDzfuJwve mRVNt J VW vyI wm tHoyiCXzyJ  pM GsBtKNiLgks  FrN bwdH H   hhSMenowoa DmXnWDLy Jgv M L j Io  Sqn SHjrtKVEtxq FwH P jX d xIZnEnkSBGNE BR hACXJfj  iSmoiTIwscly k jhmiC  vnHUUuZoQgkk oH a t xGQcqyxU RevWvaD  T  rIP y SQjpk cpzN  jkZMj I  BNom GrNyXlygM tTBSvZ KAZpWEkqeRQWUiRed SXsCxk ttgH Vk  ricFejt TTVy hy Uvtyew   IrX       END PGP SIGNATURE
