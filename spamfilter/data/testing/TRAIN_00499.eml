Re   Razor users  razor revoke  trust levels  slashdot is not  spam Attached is the slashdot digest  It seems to be plain text   Jon   On Wednesday    November             you wrote       You cannot look up your trust level at present  They are working on this   however         I don t think it would be wise for razor to even tell you which users   reported a piece as spam  much less what their confidence is  That sounds   WAY too easy to abuse by spammers to me   ie  I m a spammer  let me work on   driving down the confidence values of those who report me by submitting   nonspam to their trolls and revoke it         you should be able to see what the cf score for a given email is with   razor s debug output  I know running SA in debug mode causes razor to spew   a ton of debug output  including the scores for each part of the message   and what cf values they had      and as a side question  is the slashdot digest a multi part mime message    By default razor calls it spam if any mime part matches  This is currently   causing problems because a lot of spam and nonspam out there tends to   contain an empty mime block  I ve personally made some changes to my   razor agent conf to try to prevent some false alarms  at the expense of   missing some spam       flag only if all parts listed   logic method                  require a bit more than  average  confidence    min cf                   ac          This seems to have quelled some false alarm problems I was having  but also   makes the razor hit rate somewhat lower      At       AM                   you wrote     I just installed razor   and one of the first message i    receive as  spam  is the daily slashdot digest     I revoked this message  but it still shows up as spam     Is there a way to see what my trust level is  what the    confidence level of a given piece of spam is  and what    the trust levels are of anyone who reported the given     spam           Thanks         Jon     From   Wed Nov
