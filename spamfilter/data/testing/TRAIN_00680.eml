apt conf suggestionHi   how about applying this to the default apt conf shipped with the freshrpms net apt package   I found it a bit weird when the behaviour changed between the old     x and the new     x versions so that when doing a  apt get upgrade   it wouldn t tell me  which  packages were to be upgraded  just that it was about to upgrade something         apt conf                                         apt conf                                                        Get             Download Only  false         Show Upgraded  true                        ille Skytt  ville skytta at iki fi                                                   RPM List mailing list
