RE  CO  and climate  was RE  Goodbye Global Warming OK  let s bring some data into the discussion     A graph  derived from Vostok ice core samples  of CO  and temperature fluctuations over the past    k years      Recent high resolution studies of historical CO  concentrations and   temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest   correlation between the two  In a number of cases  CO  level increases   are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the   increase in temperature by a short time i e  increases in temperature   preceded increases in CO  concentrations  The more studies that are done   of the geological record  the more it seems that CO  concentrations are   correlated with temperature increases  but are not significantly   causative   Based on the Vostok data  you are right  there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO  concentrations  but it doesn t always appear to be causal     With respect to absolute CO  concentrations  it is also important to   point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly   regular cycle with a period of about         years   Also correct    the peak of each cycle is at about         ppm CO      As it   happens  current CO  concentrations are within     of other previous   cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data   Not correct  Mauna Loa data   In other words  we may be adding to the CO  levels   No  we are  definitely  adding to CO  levels  Look at the following chart     Shows CO  concentrations since       the  historical record     Not only is the CO  increase over     years unprecedented in the Vostok record  it is clear that the rate of change is  increasing   not decreasing  There is no other compelling explanation for this increase  except for anthropogenic input  You re really out on the fringe if you re debating this    even global warming skeptics generally concede this point     but it looks a lot like we   would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical   record   At the very least  there is nothing anomalous about current CO    concentrations   Wrong again  Current CO  levels are currently unprecedented over the past    k years  unless there is some mechanism that allows CO  levels to quickly spike  and then return back to  normal  background levels  and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores    Still  by around           we will have reached     ppm CO   a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away     Also  CO  levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately   affects temperature   Again  the interaction is not entirely   predictable  but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative   feedback systems mentioned above   Yes  clouds and oceans are a big unknown  Still  we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO   and if the world temperature doesn t increase  but we all have Seattle like weather all the time  the effects would be enormous     Last  as greenhouse gases go  CO  isn t particularly potent  although it   makes up for it in volume in some cases   Gases such as water and   methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule   basis   Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas  something   that CO  only indirectly effects through its interaction with the   biosphere   Correct   Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses     Note that methane concentrations now are  much  higher than pre industrial levels  many cows farting  and rice paddies outgassing   and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor  Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas  I m in favor of reductions in methane levels as well   Data on water vapor here       CO  was an easy mark for early environmentalism  but all the recent   studies and data I ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a   passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver   I tend to think that holistic  and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming  I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar  wind and nuclear  with all carbon based combustion using renewable sources of C H bonds  Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense  burying trees deep underground  for example   Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a  sustainable  level are unrealistic    Americans just won t do it  you d be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs   But  as California showed during last year s energy crisis  shifts in patterns of consumption are possible  and improved efficiency is an easy sell     Jim
