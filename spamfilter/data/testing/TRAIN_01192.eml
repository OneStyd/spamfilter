Re   ILUG  rpm dependenciesOn Sat  Oct          at         PM        Padraig Brady mentioned    OK I m upgrading vorbis on my machine and I m getting   the following         rpm  U libvorbis   vorbis tools       i    rpm   error  failed dependencies     libvorbisfile so     is needed by SDL mixer            libvorbisfile so     is needed by xmms            libvorbisfile so     is needed by tuxracer             This is because the new libvorbis rpm only has libvorbisfile so     So is this a problem in the other packages depending on   a specific version  libvorbisfile so    rather than on the   generic libvorbis so     This is a pain     The only way you can resolve this  to my knowledge is to download the original libvorbis rpm and the new one  Remove the old one  then do    rpm  Uvh libvorbis     RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time  and does so  Why you can t do this after you have one library already installed is beyond me   Kate      Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
