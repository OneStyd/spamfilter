Re  kde SC     Hi Nate   Am Freitag    Mai      schrieb Nate Bargmann    I also   think that setting a different wallpaper for each desktop could be more   intuitive than having to enable desktop activities in the Settings   Manager  then zoom out with the cashew  then set the wallpaper via   right click menu from each desktop  and find out it s a craps shoot      which desktop has which wallpaper   But those are nits I ve noticed      so far and are fixable   The activities system upto to KDE     IMHO is quite broken  Activity    selection is slow  it forgets which activity is mapped to which desktop    from time to time and and and    I reported about    bugs just regarding    that activity system in KDE s bugtracker  of which a user named Beat Wolf    marked most invalid in the last days cause this stuff gets completely    rewritten in KDE      In KDE     there will be a new activity system    sporting Nepomuk and whatnot  I think there has been a blog post  maybe by      Aaron Seigo on Planet KDE I agree rewriting the stuff is one of the better      things you can do with it       Let s see what comes out of it     D     Martin  Helios  Steigerwald     GPG    B   D C            AFA  B  F    B EAAC A      C        BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v        GNU Linux   iEYEABECAAYFAkvkVZsACgkQmRvqrKWZhMcSrwCgnOzyHZ x Ta XaGB gqS nzI jDQAnA  xuCA k jWoa qCS  OqU M Y  tkLt      END PGP SIGNATURE
