Re  backing up LVM volumes On Tue  April                 Bernard wrote    Hi to Everyone       On my previous systems  I used to create overall backups of partitions    using  SystemRescueCD   This is no longer possible ever since      that   I have a RAID  mirroring system on my Debian  SystemRescueCD does not   backup LVM volumes  or  if it does  that must be a very new feature  and   I have not found any doc on this      So  what should I do so as to backup my system    I once tried  dd   but   I think I remember it took forever  and I don t really know whether I   would have been able to use the resulting file to successfully restore   the partitions if needed      Could someone suggest something that has been successfully tried    Even    dd  could do  if it is OK with LVM and if I get some details  I   understand that I would have to unmount the partitions  but this is not   a problem  I have two IDE mirrored disks of     GB each      Thanks in advance for your insights     How about clonezilla    It supports LVM   not    and is based on Debian  I think you should be able to get what you need from the Debian repositories anyway   But I m not an expert          Rarely do people communicate  they just take turns talking        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
