Re  New Sequences WindowWell  I ve used the check the modify time cache trick for files in many places  not just exmh  so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective   However  it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state  then aren t we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read   Perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view   Just idle speculation   we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are   Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log  We could make that conditional on some support available in       Tcl has had  clock seconds   like gettimeofday  and  clock clicks   high resolution timer  for some time   But in     we ve calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds   It is still only useful for relative times  but each call to Exmh Log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record   Of course  we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record  etc   I ll try it out      Chris Garrigues said       From   Brent Welch        Date   Wed     Aug                                        Robert Elz said          Mh Sequence also goes and rereads the files   mh sequences and the         context file  but I m not sure how frequently that one is called             In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify    time       but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to      check their date stamp  you could just read them again         Do you really think this is true   I added a modify time check thinking    that     it would make an improvement since we were reading it a  lot  more times    in     the new code because we re trying to use the sequences         On the other hand  the sequences files are probably being read out of    cache     when that happens anyway         Even with a small file  I d think that the time taken to do a      file mtime  filename  would be worth it   My code is in proc    MhReadSeqs         Chris               Chris Garrigues                      virCIO                                   Congress  Suite        Austin  TX                                  World War III   The Wrong Doers Vs  the Evil Doers              Brent Welch Software Architect  Panasas Inc Pioneering the World s Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network                                                        Exmh workers mailing list
