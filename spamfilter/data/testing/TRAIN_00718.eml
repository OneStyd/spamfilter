Re  applets on    bit         There is a known race condition between native background repainting and   Java drawing in the resize scrolling case for Java applets embedded in   the browser process  The reason you don t see this behavior when using   the out of process plugin is because the applet painting is happening in   a seperate process  and the browser is  pulling the pixels  from the   Java process when the browser thinks it s a good time to repaint   I m not clear why unchecking the     bit  checkbox in Java Preferences   should enable or disable the out of process vs  in process applet   setting  If your MacBook is actually    bit only  you should never even   see the    bit JVMs   On May           at      AM  Rob Dickens wrote     Have just tested my applet on a    bit Mac  and it seems           you have to select the  In their own process  preference  in order   to stop the flicker on resize          unticking the    bit Java checkbox greys out the radio buttons that   let you make the above change         Ergo  the non flickering applet container is only available on    bit   Macs         If anyone from Apple could clarify the situation  I d be much obliged         On Wed  May          at       AM  Chung Kai Chen     wrote          It s really frustrating to see something on Mac so bad compared to   Windows     I use this page      to test    the newly arrived JVM and it still flickers like a hell when   scrolling the page     The same applet run on Windows hosted in VirtualBox on my Mac shows   almost    no flickering                           Rob Dickens              Dear Mac Java Devs             Have just installed the new version of Java  hoping that my   applets         in Safari  would stop flickering when I resized the browser     window  something which the release notes suggest    might be the     case    but I find that they do still flicker             One thing I note is that the Java Preferences app won t let me   change     the way applets are run  from  Within the browser process  to  In     their own process    since the radio buttons are greyed out             I m on a    bit MacBook  btw             Please could somebody help             Best regards             Rob                      Plugin  Graphics Rendering          Regards  Mike Swingler Java Runtime Engineer Apple Inc                                                    Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored  Java dev mailing list          Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription     This email sent to mlsubscriber
