Re  Kde           KDE     is lighter than KDE     was  even with desktop effects    enabled  The only time you will see it appear that KDE   is  heavy  is    if you are loading the Qt  libraries in addition to the Qt  libraries     for instance by using KDE  applications  I understand that some people    still need Quanta or the old Kdevelop  but if you are not using KDE      applications  and therefore loading Qt  libraries  then Qt  is lighter    than Qt  was      Did you measure it  If so  how     Actually  I personally have not  However  this was actually the design goal of Qt  and many users have tested and reported lower memory usage in KDE   compared to KDE    I don t know about CPU  though   Also  the last time I ran KDE        it felt was noticeably lagging compared to my then current KDE     setup on the same hardware  Note that the KDE     even had quite a few other apps installed  and the KDE        was a new install that I did to triage a possible regression   Like I said  though  if you need Qt  libraries in addition to Qt   for Quanta  for instance  then you will be using the memory of  both   naturally  and that is a lot       Dotan Cohen            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
