Rebuild at Ground     The Wall Street Journal  September          COMMENTARY  Rebuild at Ground Zero  By LARRY SILVERSTEIN  Earlier this month  we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on Sept            All of those who perished must never be forgotten  The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the    acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims  families and  indeed  for all of us   But for the good of the city and the region  the    million plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site   About        people worked in the World Trade Center  Those jobs are lost  along with those of another        people who worked in the vicinity  Together  those jobs in lower Manhattan  for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus  produced annual gross wages of about     billion  or     of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state  Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region  but many have not  New York City is facing a budget deficit  Without additional jobs  the deficit may become permanent  This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding   If we do not replace the lost space  lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world s financial center  Love them or hate them  and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue  the Towers made a powerful statement to the world that said   This is New York  a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life   That is why they were destroyed  This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced  and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement   In recent weeks  redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources  Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site  however  but on all of lower Manhattan  Further  many believe that the    million square feet either could be located elsewhere  scattered in several sites  or simply never rebuilt   These proposals miss the point  What was destroyed  and what must be recovered  was the Trade Center  not all of lower Manhattan  Except over the towers  footprints  where there must be no commercial development  the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was   Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size  That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to     occupancy before       None of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access  With the reconstruction of the subway and PATH stations  plus an additional      billion in transit improvements planned  such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct  Train to the Plane  Long Island Rail Road connection  the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development   And New York will need the space  Before       the Group of     a task force of civic leaders led by Sen  Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  concluded that the city would need an additional    million square feet of new office space by      to accommodate the anticipated addition of         new jobs  The loss of the Twin Towers only heightens the need   As for those who say that    million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market  I would simply point out that history shows them wrong  New York now has about     million square feet of office space  All new construction underway already is substantially leased up  New York had    million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in       By       this space had been absorbed  at an annual rate of about   million square feet   We are seeking to rebuild    million square feet on the Trade Center site over a period of about    years  with the first buildings not coming on line until      and the project reaching completion in       This is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet  much lower than the     s  rate   Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline  I will not accept this view  nor will most New Yorkers   Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times that the city  has to do two things  memorialize  but also build for the future   I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate    and that downtown requires    office and retail space of architectural significance  a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened  and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area   The challenge to accomplish this is enormous  But our city is up to the task   Mr  Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties  a real estate firm whose affiliates hold    year leases on the World Trade Center site                         R  A
