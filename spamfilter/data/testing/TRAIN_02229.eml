Re   Webdev  PHP Javascript requestOn Mon             at        Dave Wilson wrote    IIRC  if the query string contains      varname FIRST varname SECOND      then PHP will create a variable called  varname  with result SECOND     However  if the query string contains      varname   FIRST varname   SECOND      then PHP will create an array with varname     FIRST and varname     SECOND  By far the coolest solution to this would be to  fix  php    Take a look at main php variables c in the php source distribution  You could mess around with the variable is array in php register variable ex   and see if you can force all variables to be arrays    As far as I can tell the reason they do this is to save time by not having to work out which variables have multiple values   Nick                                                   Webdev mailing list
