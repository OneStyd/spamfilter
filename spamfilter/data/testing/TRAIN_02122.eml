Processes Run at Nice    I still have not gotten to the root of this very annoying problem   In the earliest KDE  versions  stuff started up at the normal default nice of     priority      I had a renice script to get all those akonadi daemons niced  out of the way so kde  would be usable   One version         had stuff starting at    priority     did not know there  was such an animal  but it played nicely   After that  it seems  everything of kde  s menus  desktop icons  anything it  spawns is being niced to     This renders kde  unusable  So my renicer script  sets plasma desktop  kmail and several of the core utilities back to   so I  can use it  But this workaround is no answer   I have no idea why this is going on  Any ideas        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
