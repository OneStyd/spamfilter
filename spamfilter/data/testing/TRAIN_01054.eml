Re  New Sequences WindowOuch   I ll get right on it     From   Robert Elz     Date   Wed     Aug                             Date         Tue     Aug                           From         Chris Garrigues         Message ID                 I m hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are       purely cosmetic changes       Well  first  when exmh  the latest one with your changes  starts  I get         can t read  flist totalcount unseen    no such element in array       while executing    if   flist totalcount  mhProfile unseen sequence             FlagInner

exmh folder          procedure  Exmh  line            invoked from within    Exmh          after  script       which is probably related to my not having an  unseen  sequence anywhere    certainly not in inbox    I read all of my outstanding mail before I   tried this new exmh          Second  I ve been used to having a key binding which was to Msg MarkUnseen   which doesn t seem to exist any more  and I m not sure what I should replac   e   that with    There s obviously a way as the  Sequences  menu does this    The  Mark Unseen  menu entry in the message  More  menu is still wanting   that function as well             For those who have other sequences defined  the window will widen to       display the other sequences       Any chance of having that lengthen instead    I like all my exmh stuff   in nice columns  fits the display better     That is  I use the detached   folder list  one column    The main exmh window takes up full screen    top to bottom  but less than half the width  etc         I have space for more sequences  in the  unseen  window  as long as they   remain once nice narrow window  best would be if the sequences could be   ordered by some preference  then ones which didn t fit would just fall   off the bottom  and not be shown        I d also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring    just one constant colour   I have been running the unseen window with   background black  on a root window that is all black  with no borders or   other decorations  but made  sticky    the appearance is just like the   folders with unseen messages  and their counts  are written into the   root window  because it is sticky  this small display follows me around   and do I can see when new mail needs processing        I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur   in one folder  some I had forgotten I ever created    So in addition to   the  sequences to always show  and  sequences to never show   a   preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder   would be useful  and then have the sequences that occor only in the   folder I m visiting appear in the list when that folder is current    This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining   productive  I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message   in a folder   the name is used only there  and only for one message    it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is   packed  sorted  etc        I haven t updated my exmh for some time now  so I m not sure if this   next one is new  or just new since      but the Sequences menu  on the   bar with New Flist Search      only contains  unseen  and  urgent     It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder   happens to have defined    A  New sequence  entry would also be useful    to mark the message with a sequence name that didn t previously exist    which can be done now using  Search  and the pick interface  but is   clumsy that way       Actually  you once could  now when I try this  entering a sequence name   in the pick box  and a single message number  or a range N N in the   list of messages  and no pick attributes at all  I now get          syntax error in expression  int        hit                                while executing    expr int  minlineno     msgid  minmsgid

It has been ages since I did this last though    I tried adding a Subject   to pick on  easy as I know what s in the message     which made no differen   ce    Looks as if something is now saying    hit  when before it didn t  or   similar           I ve also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the lis   t a        week or so ago       Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background    Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does  maybe this is   more apparent to me than many  as I use very small fonts everywhere    the background of the ftoc line isn t very wide        Hope this helps       kre                                                              Exmh workers mailing list              Chris Garrigues                   virCIO
