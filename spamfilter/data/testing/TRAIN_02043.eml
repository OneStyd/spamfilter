Re  libc  upgrade lenny to squeeze failed  now dpkg is brokenOn                AM  Sven Joachim wrote    On                         Chris Austin wrote       I ve learned today that when there are circular conflicts while upgrading  e g     libcairo  has to be upgraded to install xulrunner        but upgrading    libcairo  breaks xulrunner      it helps to use the dpkg   auto deconfigure    option before the  i action parameter  e g        dpkg   auto deconfigure  i libcairo           i    deb       Then dpkg gives a nice message about considering deconfiguration of    xulrunner      then decides to do it  and it works  or at least  it has done     the two or three times I have tried it today      This is indeed a nice trick to know  but apt would do this for you   automatically    Not always   Apt depends on the dependency graph being consistent  other  than perhaps containing a cycle or two   If the Debian maintainers slip  up and screw up the dependencies  or the user is switching back and  forth between distributions  say among stable  testing  and unstable    apt can get confused   It has happened to me several times   In such  cases  using aptitude sometimes helps   I have also resorted to  installing by hand  though this may not have been strictly necessary   MAA        To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
