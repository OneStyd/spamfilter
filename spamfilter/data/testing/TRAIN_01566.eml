member BELFAST BELLE writes   My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me  My mom died when I was     I had to live away from my dad and brothers  Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years  but I didn t dare tell anyone  When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers  I had no self esteem left  I experienced so much shame  and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened  Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something  When my dad died  I was devastated  It threw me into a full blown addiction  My drug use landed me in rehab  in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers  Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous  I have been clean since December           I now have great relationships with my siblings  I love them more than they will ever know  I also have a beautiful seven year old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs  I don t have any desire to use  either    just the desire to be the best pe  rson I can be    Express yourself  Tell us your thoughts on  The Secret Life of Zoey  and let us know if addiction has affected your life  Go to our Message Boards at
