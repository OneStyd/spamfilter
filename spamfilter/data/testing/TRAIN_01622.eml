Re    upon a time  dTd wrote         Thanks for the great work Mathias but I would like to point out that this   list is fastly become the apt rpm list instead of the rpm list  The   discussion concerning apt is overwhelming  Maybe another list is in order   for those having trouble with apt rpm  apt             Though I think apt rpm is a great tool  I don t use it and would like to   get back to talk of new packages and rpm building techniques   Hmmm  know what  On   the apt list has been up for a while now     There is almost no traffic though  since I wanted to keep that list for apt rpm on the server side  mirrors  building repositories etc    but hey  it could be a good place for general apt rpm questions      Matthias      Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center                                              Edificio Norte   Planta System and Network Engineer                        Barcelona  Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone                                                                     RPM List mailing list
