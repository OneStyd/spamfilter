Re  Sudden reboots with Firefox and FlashOn Tue     Apr                      Nick Douma wrote     I recently built a new computer with the following specs         Intel Core i          Gigabyte X  A UD      OCZ Platinum XTC OCZ P    LV GK   GB DDR     Gigabyte GV N   UD    I    nVidia GeForce GT         x  TB Saamsung Spinpoint F  HD   UJ    x      GB Seagate Barracuda         ST       AS       both in RAID  using Intel Matrix RAID   I hope you also get a      watts power supply to feed that equipment           Here s the problem  I initially installed Windows     bit on this pc    Whenever I tried to watch a Flash movie using Minefield and Adobe Flash         I would always get sudden reboots  It wasn t a BSOD  because I   received no such screen and no memory dumps were made  Suspecting that   it might be because of Minefield  I installed Firefox      I received   the same results  Even using IE  and Opera  I would reliably get sudden   reboots when watching Flash movies  Fed up with this  I installed Debian   Lenny as a dual boot            Can anyone advise me what to do from here on  I tried googling the   initials Firefox   Flash problems  but nothing conclusive came up  I m   posting a message on this list  because the problem is not limited to   just Windows  and I believe someone can give me some new insights on   this problem    So  as you already discarded FlashPlayer as unique source of your  reboots  I will take a look into      System overheating  reboots tend to happen due to high temperatures   watch the BIOS CPU temps and control the rpm of the fans       RAM memory modules and voltages  Check the ram dimms are certified for  you motherboard and also  look into the BIOS voltages are the correct  ones for you type of ram      Hard disks health  You can test this with  smartcl    Being a brand new computer I would suspect for bad hardware or assembly  problems      Greetings       Camale  n       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
