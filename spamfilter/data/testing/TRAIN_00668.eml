Re  Another bug Chris said       I can tell you what the  clear  and  del  arguments mean       Mh SequenceUpdate lists l k clear cur    public    This means to clear the  cur  sequence for lists l k      Mh SequenceUpdate lists l k del unseen      public    This means to delete message      from the  unseen  sequence for lists l k      Can you explain more what you were actually doing as this occurred   This    doesn t appear to be background processing   Is there significance to message           Is it the one that isn t displaying       Chris  After sending the report I started fiddling with the Ftoc RescanLine  stuff and I havn t seen it since  I can t really tell if it was my  hacking that removed it  or if it was some transitional magic  happening since this was the first invocation of that version of  exmh  I ve backed out my stuff now  and ll let you know if it happens  again    On another thing with the Ftoc RescanLine stuff  This routine is  called at times still unclar to me  An inspection of the routine  suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to form   current  state to re paint the ftoc line  However  checking the  msg tcl code  MSgChange  we find       if   msgid                    Allow null msgid from Msg ShowWhat  which supplies line  instead         if   msgid       return       else             line null too  try using first in folder         if   string length  line          set line             set msgid  Ftoc MsgNumber  Ftoc FindMsg  msgid  line             Ftoc ClearCurrent     Mh SetCur  exmh folder   msgid     Ftoc ShowSequences  exmh folder   The Ftoc ClearCurrent calls Ftoc RescanLIne to clear the     sign   before  the on disk transition is made  I hacked this stuff and more  or less changed the order  It works  but fails on some folder changes   My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a  Ftoc ClearCurrent  but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had  better know the line or msgid  That routine shoud just put in the      if the line msg in question happened to be the cur msg  Thoughts     Anders                                                           Exmh workers mailing list
