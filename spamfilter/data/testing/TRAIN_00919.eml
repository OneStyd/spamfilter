Re  cross connecting console ports Hi Miles   On Mon  May          at         PM        Miles Fidelman wrote    Short of buying a remote KVM  it occurs to me that it might be possible         to cross connect the serial ports on the two computers   using a terminal        program on one  to access the other  and vice versa   This works fine  I do it all the time when testing hardware     Has anybody done this   Any suggestions on where to start   both re        cabling  USB vs  serial cross over   and or software   These days it becomes easier to have a bunch of USB ports than a bunch of serial ports  so USB serial converters are cheap and useful and I ve yet to find one that doesn t just work under Debian   I used to use minicom  but lately I use  screen  dev ttyUSB        or whatever   Cheers  Andy             No nonsense VPS hosting       BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux   iEYEAREDAAYFAkvyB wACgkQIJm TL VSQsKWQCg uRsdNBv tkledlhLUbrngdQ PwcAnjQYQ Lbcy Q ZA   k kWRFnZmE  LGTP      END PGP SIGNATURE
