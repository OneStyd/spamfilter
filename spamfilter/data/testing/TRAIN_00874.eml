Re  Another bug  From   Chris Garrigues     Date   Mon     Jul                           From   Anders Eriksson       Date   Mon     Jul                             My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a      Ftoc ClearCurrent  but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had      better know the line or msgid  That routine shoud just put in the          if the line msg in question happened to be the cur msg  Thoughts       Intuitively  that sounds right to me   It does also call  tag remove   so    you ll have to make sure that gets set correctly as well       I think any changes that make it behave more intuitively are a good thing even    if they mean we have something else to fix   Of course  that attitude is why    I ve been fixing exmh bugs for   weeks   I just checked in a code cleanup which doesn t address this issue  but does  take a machete to code right around it   You ought to  cvs update  and see if  your issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed   My patch notes that  msgid  and  line  are redundant with one another and removes  one or the other from functions which takes both   The callers are then  changed to pass what the function expects   In the case of Msg Change  the   line  argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument   Ftoc ClearCurrent is now the first line of MsgChange   Chris      Chris Garrigues                   virCIO                                Congress  Suite     Austin  TX                            World War III   The Wrong Doers Vs  the Evil Doers           BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Exmh version                          iD DBQE PHoCK b h R IUIRAl kAJ C pnFLKlVYbRToLtffnXa ffZJwCfahTx BE ZJXQ LnbKyCuhuS IJBg   aAkz      END PGP SIGNATURE
