Re  What to choose for Core i     bits     If you have other i    machines around  it may be convenient for you to     keep the same architecture so you can share the download bandwidth of     Debian updates  and things like that    On the other hand  now might be a good time to begin the migration to the   future      bits will be around for a long time  but it will increasingly be   relegated to older hardware and niche applications  such as embedded   processors or cell phones and the like      bits is going to be the    current  architecture for desktops  servers  and the like for a good while   to come   That s true   I used to say and think that     back around      when I started to use DEC Alpha machines   But now that  GB is about as little RAM as you can get in a new machine  the push to move to   bit is very real            Stefan       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
