Re   fwd  error exmh                 Chris   I think you are referring to a problem I noticed last October  see  attached email   If I remember correctly  the binding for SeditBeautify is being applied outside of the sedit window and that results in the  behavior observed   Kevin  In message    Chris Garrigues writes       Am I the only one for whom typing control L to the main window causes this    error       I can t figure out why it occurs       Chris       It appears that the binding for SeditBeautify applies to more than just the sedit window  Since SeditBeautify assumes we are in a sedit window the routine fails   Try typing ctrl l over the main window to see what I mean    The quick fix for this is to make the  l more restrictive  However  I d suggest keeping things the way the are and extending  l to be a highlight toggle  If the window is currently highlighted  sedit or msg  re display without highlighting and vice versa   While I can hack tcl  hacking tk is another story  Translation  I can t  fix this bug myself  Any volunteers   Kevin                                                     Exmh workers mailing list
