Re  KDE unable to play complete K B  wav filesHi   On Sat  May         at       PM  Nate Bargmann   wrote      On         May              Diederik de Haas wrote     On            Nate Bargmann wrote       In System Settings configure notification  also from the same menu in      configure K B  only the first note is played        Tried it from K b and I can confirm your findings         In Dolphin clicking on k b success  wav launches gnome mplayer and the      entire file is played        Same here  although I ve played it with both Amarok as smplayer         Also in Dolphin with k b success  wav highlighted clicking the play      button in the far right hand pane plays the first three notes        Same here          Here is an oddity I ve noticed       It sure is odd      Thanks for the confirmation  Diederik   C  A I wonder which package to fi  le a   bug report against   C  A The k b package may in fact be easiest to reque  st   that the sound files be packaged in  ogg format  but that only masks   that fact that something in the KDE sound stack is having an issue with    wav files      My system is configured to use the Phonon Xine Backend in Sound and Video   Configuration   C  A Could that be the culprit and how can we test        Nate                The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all   possible worlds   C  A The pessimist fears this is true       Ham radio  Linux  bikes  and more       Triying with dragonplayer it also fails with xine backend  amarok and kaffeine on the other hand play it complete   Switched to gstreamer backend and DragonPlayer played it successfully   I think you may have to file two separate bugreports  one to k b suggesting as a new feature to use ogg files instead of wavs  and a separate to phonon indicating to xine backend fails to play k b s files   But since it does play ok with amarok  which also uses phonon  probably will be nice to ask this question to a phonon developer  maybe that the issue is in k b and dragonplayer   Cheers  Ismael       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
