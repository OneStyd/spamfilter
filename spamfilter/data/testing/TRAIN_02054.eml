A couple of nits    I have a couple of small issues  and I m not sure if their exmh issues or my setup issues   First  when I try and run exmh with wish from tk      it seems to take forever to start  but with wish from tk  a   it starts in a snap   Using the latest CVS  when I open exmh and the folder I m in has unseen messages and I hit next  exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder   Finally  when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen  exmh always goes back to inbox  which has no unseen messages  rather than the next folder with unseen messages    When I  goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go    Just wanted to let you know what I m seeing and find out if I m expecting some different than I should be   Thanks for all the effort  Jim                                                     Exmh workers mailing list
