Re   ILUG  How to copy some files    Date  Fri     Jul                         From   Matthew French             Niall asked         I have about   G of data which I need to copy from one disk to        another           The problem is the bulk of the data                have two directory entries i e  there is a hard link                  How about something like              cd  dest dir         tar  C  source dir  cf     tar xf            tar cf   will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf   will untar it  This     should keep permissions and links  and if you do it as root you will keep     the owners too                Not tested  though  You may need other flags as well    the above  or something close to it  will work    however  the data will be read and written twice by the   st  source   tar   and read twice by the  nd  sink   tar    albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second  copy is a hard link to the first   with c   Gb of data   that will make a difference  at least in time and CPU  resource consumed  albeit  in this case  not storage     the issue here is tar     and cpio     archives always  contain the data for each name of a hard link   this is   probably  for several reasons  and is not necessarily a  bad thing    e g   it provides a degree of redundancy to  help cope with bad media    the source  tar  is creating an archive  which is being  written down the pipe  to be consumed by the sink  tar     that is why storage is not an issue per se here  as the  full archive is not  saved      if it were  you d need  at least  x  Gb  or over    Gb     the extra is  tar s  overhead  which is minimal but does add up  esp  when  a  large  blocking factor is used    cheers    blf      Innovative  very experienced  Unix and        Brian Foster    Dublin  Ireland  Chorus  embedded RTOS  kernel internals       e mail     expert looking for a new position             mobile        or                 For a r  sum    contact me  or see my website         Stop E  o  ExxonMobile      Whatever you do  don t buy Esso     they      don t give a damn about global warming              Supported by Greenpeace  Friends of the Earth  and numerous others         Irish Linux Users  Group      for  un subscription information  List maintainer
