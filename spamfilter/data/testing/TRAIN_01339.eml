Re   Razor users  What s wrong with the Razor servers now  On Thursday  August          at        AM  Gregory Sloop wrote     I agree  I think          But gaming the system  for any system   spamassassin included  is extra   work   Yes  it s definitely extra work   The question is how much extra  work  both up front  and then on an ongoing basis   I know  nothing about how the trust system is working  still waiting for  that long promised server code to be published   but now that  it s been turned on  and the more info that s coming out about  it  the more concerned I m becoming that it s extremely easy to  game  that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent  is low  and that once it s set up  it can be  fire and forget   in terms of continuing to operate in a way that s not easy to  distinguish from real user behavior     Sure  you can find a way to work almost any system  but few    users  spammers    will actually take the time to game the system   Another concern I have with the way the system might be working  is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to  utterly undermine the whole system   There are a certain number  of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive  to liars  or misclassifiers of  gray  mail  or both   It s not  clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not     That means that we might have a system that is less than         effective  but   perfect accuracy and effectiveness comes at a prohibitive cost      Complex   systems  time numbing hours of coding etc    You do need a certain level of accuracy though  or the filter is  not economically worthwhile   If you only filter     of spam   you re wasting your time   Some people receive on the order of a       ratio of spam real mail        means the ratio adjusts to      which is still shitty       makes it      which is better        makes it      which is quite nice   As the global ratio of  spam mail rises  this problem gets somewhat more important    With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam real  ratio             effective still works OK       effective is  now really  really shitty      I can t vouch for Razor currently  as I m not at all    knowledgeable  But I   suspect the current route was picked because it was fairly simple to   impliment  and it  at least some think  should work decently   if not   completely without fault   Time will tell   Time will also tell how good the system is at  adjusting over time to gaming strategies     I put up with some garbage results in SA  simply because it    blocks most of   my spam  without too many false positives   SA definitely has a non zero FP rate  and always will have   I  would argue that any system will have a non zero FP rate   including the  no filter  filter    humans make mistakes too  sometimes   As spammer strategies evolve over time though  I m  fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate   If  spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust  system  I m not sure how easy it ll be to replace the trust  system with something else     Perhaps Craig is just theorizing  but I just thought I d offer my two   ity bits   Lots of theorizing  most of it based on little data   The key  premises I m worrying about though are      Trust system is easy to pollute    Trust system is not personal  which makes the assumption that  all honest voters agree on what constitutes spam     Somthing simple  and actually implimented  that works    reasonably well  is   better than somthing that works perfectly  but will never be    implimented   because of it s cost   The rub is that everyone defines     reasonably well  in   dramatically different ways    grin  as evidenced my the masses    that think   Microsoft s stuff works  resaonably well   bah     but it does    keep me fully   employed  sigh    Razor  seems to have been a long time in coming  apparently is  quite resource intensive  judging by Cloudmark s fundraising  efforts   and doesn t currently work   It has great promise  and  I m hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through  it ll add  another powerful tool in the war on spam    I m just concerned  that it s getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to  recover   C                                                            This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven                                                    Razor users mailing list
