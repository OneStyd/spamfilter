today             To all you Dream Theater fans out there  please accept my humblest of apologies   I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section  causing  quite a stir among a number of subscribers  In fact  they just released a double  album this year and have been touring in support of that release   For today s false alarm  please make note of the tragedy that is the N

is good   I m  sure it would be better on a color screen  like the     but for what I ll need   this works well  I m currently looking for an ssh client I can install  so that  remote server logins will be possible  My one complaint is the base station s  use of a serial connector instead of USB  but I suppose they were cutting costs     I m also scoping out the      PML  standard for marking up Palm Docs   in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier  I ve installed several of  the files on my phone and while they are easy to read  have all the content  organized  and function as useful tips for the various subjects  I d like to add  some minor tweaks to future tomes  so that they look even better for me and  anyone else who reads them on their Palm          Jake Ludington

Features worth a look Thornton and Coen Brothers Commentary   Much more film noir  than a movie trying to imitate film noir  The Man Who Wasn t There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre  Ed Crane  Billy Bob Thornton  is the archetype everyman  A barber by trade  Crane represents the individual in society  He hears everything  but truly knows nothing  Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by the retelling  He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations  Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him  Crane develops an indifference to it all  When a snake oil sales man slithers into town  Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish the punishers   As indifferent as Crane appears  he is no match for the amorality of fate  As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath  however  so is it artistic in its execution  That is what makes our lives so entertaining  Fate doles ultimate justice  but never as expected  The Man Who Wasn t There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual s year to turn against the tide of inevitability  Atypical of cuter  more recent Coen brothers fare  this film is reminiscent of their earlier noir works like Blood Simple and Miller s Crossing  Frances McDormand does an outstanding job making as Crane s selfish wife and James Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris  boss  The real outstanding performances  however  rest with the supporting cast  Tony Shalhoub  as pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil salesman impress and entertain as cruel  but offbeat parodies of their characters  The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane s life and the monochromatic nature of fate
