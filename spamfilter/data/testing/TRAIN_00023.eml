Re  Realtek ethernet  was Re  recent mobo recommendation Ron Johnson put forth on                 PM     Nothing I ve seen in dmesg has ever led me to think that the r       driver in my Sid linux source        kernel  yes  it s old      and      fail to build  loads a blob   Almost all NICs load firmware blobs   It s in dmesg somewhere   When the firmware doesn t load you get something like this in dmesg   eth   RTL    d     d at  xffffc     c e    xx xx xx xx xx xx  XID       c  IRQ    eth   unable to apply firmware patch  That s a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the        trunk upgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob   I can t find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load  Here s what it looks like for Intel     X using the e    driver  with the firmware blobs all compiled into the kernel   e             d    firmware  using built in firmware e    d   m ucode bin   built in  signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel at compile time   I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem   It only adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image   And I use the vanilla kernel org sources to avoid any Debian  non free  issues   Just about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob   There are  IIRC    ways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel   This applies to all devices that require soft firmware  not just NICs       Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel     Compile the individual blob into the driver  use initrd     Put firmware file in root filesystem  tell kernel the path     won t work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as block device drivers   Those require method   or     NICs should be able to use       There are   different dmesg statements and   different errors depending on which method     above that you re using      At least a couple of people on this list went out and bought    non RealTek PCI    NICs to fix the problem instead of reverting to the older kernel       I sort of remember that   Yeah  I just pulled the mails   One upgraded to        trunk on his firewall  bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an Intel e    IIRC   They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the firmware load failure message referenced up above in this email   The other had an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason   I can t recall how they fixed that one   IIRC the OP didn t swap hardware to achieve the fix  so they did something with the kernel driver firmware     I m not surprised   Since I m only connected to a small    Mbps LAN   which then connects to a   Mbps cable modem  it doesn t really affect me   Do some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what transfers rates you get out of that RTL chip   I bet you get    rd wire speed at best  about   MB s  if even that   The machines themselves need to be modern to saturate the link  no slow CPUs or disks   Any   GHz CPU with    MB RAM and a decent    K RPM SATA disk should be able to push pull   MB s across the wire   For that matter  eliminate the disk by creating a    MB RAM disk on each machine   Create a test file with dd and FTP SCP it back and forth between the RAM disks   If your RTL chip can peak the wire it ll be a     second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up to the task     Maybe if I ever get     or     I ll squeal in anger   Until then     It s looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the trunk kernel   You may get lucky   Then again  if you roll your own and put the firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do  you shouldn t have a problem   That is  if the Debian kernel source doesn t have the blob ripped out for being  non free    You mentioned you had problems building        and     kernel source   Do you use the Debian kernel source or kernel org source   I ve been using the kernel org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems with it  knocks on wood    I had a build problem with     a while back but that turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine in this warmer weather           Stan       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
