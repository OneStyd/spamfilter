Re  What needs to improve in KDE   On    May             Adrian von Bidder   wrote    Dotan      On Monday    May               Dotan Cohen wrote     I started     on a new    kde    folder  can you try in a new user profile and report back      I hate it when this shows up   C  A Yes  it s probably easier to debug  b  ut often   bugs  do  show up that don t happen anymore when I remove my    kde   directory  but this doesn t really help the user who has the bug    Unfortunately  the end result is very often that removing    kde and   starting from scratch becomes the only solution that is  officially    recommended     I know  but it helps to know if the bug is in the config file or the software package  The config file  should  have been updated when the KDE version was  and I need to know that      Fine   C  A Except that reconfiguring my desktop to how I want it takes a  ges   C  A I   use offline IMAP and have    s of MB of email in my    kde that will need   to   be re downloaded   C  A And stuff like the calendar etc  is in there  too     C  A And   the nepomuk database etc     You can copy those parts right back over      So yes  KDE people may well want to know if a bug happens on old   configurations only or if it happens on new configurations  but I think   there s an attitude problem here  KDE needs to become MUCH better at deal  ing   with unexpected input from its configuration   C  A  I don t have a preci  se   example right now  I ll try to report this kind of issue when I see it ne  xt    Admittedly  KDE has improved in this area as well      I agree with you       I really do          Dotan Cohen            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
