Re  Re      xorg server failing on IBM NetVista with Intel        videoOn Fri     May                      EDT   Peter Easthope wrote      Runs OK   These lines appear on the console      xserver xorg video intel                               update initramfs  Generating  boot initrd img                  This should also have caused lilo to be run  if the customization is correct   There are only two or three lines of output from lilo  so it s easy to overlook     The first seemed promising but no such luck          Under the             kernel X still shuts down with the message     error setting MTRR     Inappropriate ioctl for device         I found this thread on the internet   I don t know if it s your problem  but it s worth looking at   I always use GNOME  so I have no experience with messing with  xinitrc        Stephen Powell wrote     If everything was customized correctly  the symlinks should    be automatically updated and lilo should be automatically run       Lilo continues to work and all appears well       dalton    ll  boot i    lrwxrwxrwx   root root         May           boot initrd img    initrd img                 rw r  r     root root         May           boot initrd img                 rw r  r     root root         May           boot initrd img              bak    rw r  r     root root         May           boot initrd img                 rw r  r     root root         May           boot initrd img              bak   lrwxrwxrwx   root root         May           boot initrd img old    initrd img                dalton    ll  boot v    lrwxrwxrwx   root root         May           boot vmlinuz    vmlinuz                 rw r  r     root root         Sep           boot vmlinuz                 rw r  r     root root         Feb           boot vmlinuz                lrwxrwxrwx   root root         May           boot vmlinuz old    vmlinuz                dalton        Stephen Powell wrote        you will normally want to manually purge any older kernels that are    still installed to save disk space  after  the upgrade       Will do     At this point  you only have two kernels installed  so there s nothing to purge right now   But be sure to add the optional flag to the LinuxOld section in  etc lilo conf   Without it  lilo will generate an error if there are not at least two kernels installed       Any chance of you posting the customization instructions on    your Web site   Well  I already have  sort of   The trouble is that it s buried in a larger document on custom kernel building   People see that and think   Oh  I m not building a custom kernel  so I don t need to read this   But Step    on my kernel building page        talks about customizing the kernel installation environment  and that part is applicable to both stock and custom kernels   The instructions for customizing the Lenny environment work for Squeeze also  provided that you use  only  stock kernels   The minute you introduce a custom kernel  you  must  use the hook scripts  as documented in the Squeeze section     Stephen Powell wrote     There is a newer kernel available in squeeze now                 Sid isn t it   But if this is a kernel bug  it is worthy     of fixing for squeeze   But no harm in trying the sid    kernel I suppose   As I explained in another post  yes  it is in Sid   If you need instructions for how to pull in the Sid kernel without upgrading your whole system to Sid  let me know and I can provide that  Also  you might try disabling ACPI and try the vesa driver  as explained in another post                   Stephen Powell                                  To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
