Re  traceback in new exmh  From   Scott Lipcon     Date   Mon     Sep                         The speed is a problem for sure   It takes a long time to do the   rescanning of sequences  I associate it with hitting the  flist    button  or when my background flist goes off      I m running on a   pretty fast system  Athlon           Mb RAM    k RPM ultra SCSI disk    and hitting flist used to take no more than a second   The big   difference might just be perception  because the the old code just   updated all the folders  count   color  all at once  instead of making   it look like there is   unseen  then counting its way back up         I doubt I ll have much time in the immediate future to hack at this    but if I do   can you suggest areas that might be the best to   optimize    If not  do you think we can put in some preferences to   disable some of the more intensive features    I d rather disable all   the sequence support  except unseen  of course  and have reasonable   speed    I suspect people on slow machines would find the current   state unusable   If I knew where the problem was  I d fix it myself   Finding it is probably more work than the actual fix            This is because of your Hook MsgShow update unseen which is calling a fun   ctio     n      which no longer exists           I suspect you need      Seq Del  exmh folder  unseen  msgid     now instead of       Mh MarkSeen  exmh folder   msgid           Thanks   I m not sure I ll need it with the new sequence code  but I   might   Does your new code commit sequences immediately   The old code   didn t  so I put that in to help keep my mh and exmh windows in sync   Yes it does   Chris      Chris Garrigues                   virCIO                                Congress  Suite     Austin  TX                            World War III   The Wrong Doers Vs  the Evil Doers           BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE      Version  GnuPG v       GNU Linux  Comment  Exmh version                          iD DBQE kKD K b h R IUIRAp DAJsF W  cvbayu szYhYW TUdAb  QCfT  t vgMbAAyyOjJW   cwD wpfk    Rwl      END PGP SIGNATURE
