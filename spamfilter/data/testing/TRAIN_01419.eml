Re  Trouble setting environment variablesOn Thu  May          at         PM        Jason Filippou wrote    Hi       I ve been trying to set my PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables so that   they point to my JDK s bin and some Java source files respectively and this   is what I ve written in my  profile file         PATH should also include the latest jdk  bin  directory   PATH   usr lib jvm java   sun          bin  PATH          set the CLASSPATH variable to include anything I do with java    CLASSPATH   home jason code java  CLASSPATH       Yet I don t seem to have much luck  since  echoing  both environment   variables gives me the old value of PATH for PATH and nothing for CLASSPATH            echo  PATH    usr lib eclipse    bin i    linux  home jason bin  usr local bin  usr bin  bin  usr games        echo  CLASSPATH                This is strange  especially for PATH  because earlier in my  profile I ve   written         set PATH so it includes the eclipse bin directory     PATH   usr lib eclipse    bin i    linux  PATH       And if you notice the output produced by  echo   this directory is well   under the scope of PATH   Perhaps the eclipse directory is added to PATH elsewhere  eg  in   profile in your home directory  or there is a separate  export  line  in  etc profile        What am I doing wrong  Do I need to  export  something   Certainly     export PATH     export CLASSPATH           Thanks   Cheers  David       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian    with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
