boss should be sending you to Gnomedex  Some of the leading experts on content management solutions  those things we affectionately call blogs  will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general  Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging  Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives  If that s not enough incentive  remind the boss that THE Internet security guru  Steve Gibson  will be sharing his wisdom as well    Register for Gnomedex today             I ve finally done it  Lockrgnome s Top       is in publication  and available for purchase at GnomeTomes com  Less than half the tips have  appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already  so purchasing them means  getting mostly brand new content  This represents the first thing I ve  written that people might actually pay to read  so if we sell one copy   I ll be ecstatic  And hopefully  any of you who check out the tips will  find them useful  I know that figuring out how to do each of the    things  on the list has improved my personal OS X experience    Although this newsletter started out with Chris  Randy  and I writing  sections of the newsletter  time constraints have limited the  contributions of the other two guys  This does not mean either of them is  truly less involved  it just means I m doing more writing  Both Chris and  Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find  much of which  will ultimately end up in upcoming issues  Since the writing will be  primarily mine  I ve opted to eliminate the  Review by  links at the bottom  of each article  Unless otherwise noted  you can safely assume I wrote it   If you need to send me an e mail  the E mail The Editors Link in the  sidebar will reach me  as well as putting your message in front of Chris  and Randy    I ve been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months  and believe I m finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I m going  to add a section on scripting to the newsletter  I m curious to know what  your level of experience with scripting is  because I can either start with  some really basic stuff  or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting  topics  Either way  I m open to some   AppleScript suggestions       See You in  Jake Ludington nbsp

particularly  useful in situations where one user created a file  but an entirely  different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions  relating to that file  like whether to keep it or throw it in the  Trash  chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this  From  the command line type    sudo chown username filename   You ll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for  username  The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will  replace filename                 LINUX TIPS   From the mind behind the Penguin Shell come two  more eBooks in the
