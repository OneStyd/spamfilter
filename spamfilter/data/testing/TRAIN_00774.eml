Re  Snow Leopard  Java   and NetbeansHas anyone tried it with the   M     or  M     developer preview  I m   somewhat concerned that this is a demonstrable regression between Java     and Java     however there are several other factors that can impact   memory use        vs     bit  biggest culprit        client    bit tuned garbage collection options running on       server    bit   client vs  server HotSpot itself  more aggressive compilation and   storage of compiled code   Anecdotally  I ve talked to several people who have large long running      bit processes on Snow Leopard with  GB of RAM machines who were   having a miserable time  While reverting to    bit may be a quick fix   for some  others who tuned the GC parameters or turned on    XX  UseCompressedOops  which compresses Java references to    bit   values in the heap  found that they could reclaim or even exceed their   original    bit performance  since they were still using the server   JVM    Since someone mentioned that NetBeans     Beta was working well  I d   suggest taking a look at it s JVM options and see if there wasn t some   tweaking done to optimize it for a    bit by default world   Best of

work    It s just stable enough for daily use   I do   restart NB every few hrs when the memory use gets out of hand    apparently some object leaks with the apple jvm nb combo      can t   switch it back to java    so kinda stuck with it  So I m probably just   going to switch to IntilliJ  I ve found it s performance to be a lot   better than NB overall    File tree nav is painless for example         I m kinda sad about it  but got work to get done           On Apr           at      AM    wrote          Hmm  I m using the late      Macbook Pro       GHz upgraded to   GB        GB  RAM   I m using the latest Java through Software Update  and my   app is Swing based  using Matisse  and using the Swing Application   Framework with an embedded Derby database  though I will note that I   have issues even before any files are open  Just expanding the tree to   get to a file for opening tended to take about    seconds  and that s   assuming I didn t switch to another window in the meantime           I just did a full wipe reinstall of Netbeans to see if my settings   were a problem  but I had no change until I loaded in Java   and saw a   significant difference  I ll be trying out the suggestions people made   about using a different target platform than the one Netbeans is running   on  but I m starting to wonder if there is an issue with my system           On Apr              am

             I am developing a Java     running on GlassFish using Postgres as the database   This is a port of   he Java EE   app I architected in      and deployed in      on JBoss   using eclipse   JBoss Dev Studio as the IDE   It is a lot more than a   port since there a number of enhancements                           I have made no changes to the Java or preferences for NetBeans   Of   course the Java for my app is     and NetBeans runs on     as well                           I do see an increase in activity when there is an open dialog box so   I keep an eye out for them   I watch CPU activity since I had an issue   with Kernel panics a month ago   Turned out to be a combination of a   failing disk drive and a memory stick  Replaced the    G drive with    G   and the  G stick with  G  to make total of  G     Apple store guys could   not see the problems but through some handy tools and taking to external   service personnel we were able to zero in on the problem and fix it                           Side note  I have shutdown plugins in Safari mainly to keep Flash   from running   Some sites caused Flash plugin to push usage up to     or   more   I have been using iStat menu  I recommend  and also launch   activity monitor at login just to keep an eye on things                           On Apr           at      AM  Jon Eisenstein wrote                            I imagine this topic comes up every so often but I haven t been   able to find it in the archives     rom what I understand  there s some   issue with Snow Leopard and Java   that makes Netbeans     near   unusable   I ve had to do my development on a lesser powered PC because   there  things will actually open without pegging the CPU at      and   becoming unresponsive   Following a tip  I used Pacifist to reinstall   Leopard s Java   back onto the system  set it as the default  and tried   to launch Netbeans  Lo and behold  it was fast  responsive and showed   none of the problems I d been used to  Unfortunately  it made it so that   I couldn t work on my Java   based app                             So  what is the actual situation here  Is this a known issue with   the Apple JVM that s  hopefully  going to get fixed  Is this a bug in   Netbeans  Am I the only one seeing issues this bad  and so it could be a   problem with my setup  Is there a workaround  Any help would be vastly   appreciated    the Windows box is having disk issues  and I d love to   move my primary development to the Macbook Pro as soon as possible  And   if push comes to shove  I may have to just rearchitect the project into   Java    which would not be a simple task                                                                           Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored
