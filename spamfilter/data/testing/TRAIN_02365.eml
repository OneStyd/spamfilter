Re  Best way to install kde standardOn            Sven Joachim wrote      Suggestions       File a bug report   I first want to know if I m the only one and or try to find the cause of the issue before filing a bug  report  But I ll start a separate thread for it        Since the noveau driver didn t seem capable of rendering kde kdm properly     I installed the nvidia  drivers  the debian way        Does hibernating work with the nvidia driver   BTW  nouveau should work   fine if you disable desktop effects   Nope  hibernating does not work with the nvidia driver  but I didn t couldn t test it with the  nouveau driver  since I couldn t get a login screen to begin with and Ctl Alt F  didn t respond  either  so it was unusable for me  Had to do Ctl Alt SysRq  REISUB  and boot into single user mode to get my system working again   Desktop effects seems to be disabled by default on laptops  so that s probably not it   Diederik       To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact   Archive
